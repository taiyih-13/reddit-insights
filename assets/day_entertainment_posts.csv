This was also inspired by the fact I just realized Back to the Future was celebrating its 40th anniversary. 

That got me thinking, Back to the Future very much feels like an 80’s movie. It’s def a snapshot in time. Last night I rewatched Wall Street which is 1987 and it very much feels like a product of its era. There’s no way watching that movie that you ever forget it’s a different era. 

I also rewatched the Ocean’s trilogy this week and the new original Ocean’s Eleven is almost 25 years old. But when you watch it it doesn’t seem like a product of its time. It could have been made a month ago and probably would look mostly the same. 

Then I started thinking further back and movies like Speed and the Fugitive don’t feel like 30 year old movies.

There's a few threads around on it, but the most recent one is from a year ago. I've read through them all and an fascinated by the range of responses to the film, from loving the first 20 mins and hating the rest of the film to viewing it as one of the best cosmic horror films of the last decade or longer.

I fall into the latter camp. I thought it was brilliant. Sure, a little poorly paced in the middle, definitely has a lot thrown into the mix, and depending on your interpretation there's a number of logical inconsistencies - I get why people might not like it, but I loved it.

After watching it though—which then made me want to go back and watch the 2005 adaptation again as an adult—I am FULLY and unapologetically in the corner of Tim Burton's version.

The main reason people argue that the Tim Burton version is better is because it is more faithful to the book. But I agree with the 1971 crowd in that just because something is more faithful to the source material does not necessarily mean it is automatically a better movie. I think *The Amazing Spider-Man* series is more faithful to the comic books than the Sam Raimi *Spider-Man* series, but I think the Sam Raimi *Spider-Man* series are better movies overall.

Great years in my opinion were 1988, 2004, 2007 and my favorite year 2024.

Why are the ghost people aging? Sure they're actors. It's certainly been a long time since James Remar was in The Warriors. Or Sex and The City, for that matter. But why would he age as a figment of Dexter's imagination?

In the second episode, Dexter waits until staff from a nice hotel use a clearly labelled staff entrance, then hangs out in a bar until all the kitchen staff leave, and they do so through by walking through the bar. I think the guys over at r/kitchenconfidential can see the issues here. What top end hotel allows it's back of house staff enter guest areas? Also, do they not have dishies?

He’s a comedic genius and so under appreciated. He speaks to our humanity so well and captures the mundane, little moments perfectly. I love this show with all my heart, and all his other shows are hilarious too, his character work is unmatched.

Austin Powers in Goldmember may not be the best of the trilogy for many but it’s the one I rewatched the most growing up and the one that has so many hilarious moments that stick in my mind. It’s ridiculous fun and I love it.

It played to the lowest common denominator and in doing so, completely wasted a brilliant setup.

The film starts with Dave, a man who sees himself as calm and non-confrontational. That alone is rich territory for storytelling. So many people go through life believing they’re composed and reasonable, unaware of how much anger they carry just beneath the surface, the kind that doesn’t explode but seeps out through sarcasm, withdrawal, passive-aggression, or quiet resentment.

movies,What are some of your favorite movies where you'd change the third act or climax?,iamyourmanchild,5,0.86,11,2025-07-26 02:31:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1m9i2g3/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_movies_where_youd/,"I think a lot about how endings define the meaning of a story. Not just what happens, but how it happens. Sometimes the third act hijacks everything a film was doing right, either out of pressure to deliver a twist, or to force closure where ambiguity was (or wasn't) enough.

I’m curious what movies stuck with you almost perfectly...until the final stretch. Here's mine:

Hereditary: It was already devastating as a slow, quiet dissection of grief and inherited trauma. But when the supernatural stuff fully took over in the third act, it turned the internal into something external and mythological. I would’ve kept it grounded. Let the horror stay psychological. No kings of hell. Just a mother breaking under the weight of everything she’s lost. That’s enough horror. It always has been.

Would love to hear yours. Not in a ""fix the movie"" way, but in a ""here’s what felt truer to the story I thought I was watching"" way.

Those are 

Rush: when this was released F1 wasnt very popular but now its a whole different story.

 So i think this film could be a classic instead of just a cult classic if it got a re release

Another one is Encanto. I know The songs now have become iconic and chárter really high on the billboard  charts.

 But this film was released in an unfurtunate  time when people were still scared to go to the theaters due to the Virus. 

This film deserved the billion dollar mark at the box office and be part of the huge Disney classics instead of just a niche Classic like Pocahontas or Hunchback. 


Disney animated films have its classics and their underdogs classic or niche classics.

And i think Encanto with a Re release could turn into a full on classic  ",Discussion,1m97vcu,1.8,9.0,99.0,11.0,4.380959453611111,0.9909145257646544,108.0005380507008,Reviews & Discussions,high
