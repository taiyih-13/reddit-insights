So maybe it's because I'm older but I don't recall the show being this dumb and full of plot holes. I think it's a byproduct of Dexter no longer being a part of a police department, and having far less access to personal data and crime scenes.

I still find the show very enjoyable, if tired, but some of the elements in the show have really stuck out to me as incredibly stupid.

Saying this, I really enjoy Michael C Hall's phenomenal performance. That's what's kept me sticking around. I'm really glad they brought the dad back as Dexter's dark passenger. Their chemistry has always been off the charts. Harrison's scenes...I have to admit, I skip through most of them.
