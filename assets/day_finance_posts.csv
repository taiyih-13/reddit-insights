So i took this trade on because bitcoin was bearish on Wednesday and it ended on the morning of Friday.  the higher timeframe and according to price action i knew it would drop down to the 115700 level at least as it had a fair value gap there. I took my entry, followed my plan, placed my TP and SL and let price work it self out. 

This trade had a risk to reward ratio of 1:7 and it also was the longest trade i had taken. 

i ended up making **$4900** on this trade as i did take 50% of my position off at the first TP level. 

I also screen recorded this whole trade and i will be uploading it to my YT shorts later today. 

Before anyone says it's fake i have uploaded my broker connected to my Tradingview app's screenshot as well.

This massive government spending programme is set to create a gold rush for defence contractors. I've done a deep dive on which companies stand to benefit the most.

Lockheed Martin (LMT): The obvious giant, making most of the existing systems the Dome will be built on. However, they just posted a disastrous earnings report (a 78% EPS miss!) and look like they might be fumbling. Is it a value trap? I have a recent article explaining in full why I don't like this one much.

Northrop Grumman (NOC): The momentum play. This company is executing flawlessly, crushing its earnings, and has already won the contracts for the next-gen B-21 bomber and Sentinel ICBMs. Crucially, their CEO just confirmed they are *already testing* the advanced space-based interceptors for the Dome.

I doubt anyone would invest in the market if they did not expect, to some degree, that their investment would grow over a long enough time horizon.

But how do you rationalize that assumption? Is it purely based on a historical assessment that market value has tended to grow in the past, so it will continue to grow? Do you believe that, at some point in the future, the actions necessary to maintain that growth will be untenable?

CryptoMarkets,Still holding my ADA bag from 2018… Should I finally let go?,LumiCurvesThatFlow,48,0.81,92,2025-07-26 08:03:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m9ntqy/still_holding_my_ada_bag_from_2018_should_i/,"I’ve been holding ADA since 2018. I believed in the project early on and I still like a few things about Cardano. But over time, I’ve averaged my position down to about $1.50, and I’m starting to question whether it’s worth holding onto anymore.

Back in the day, I saw all the confident predictions that ADA could hit $5–$7 easily, even when market cap logic didn’t quite add up. I got back into crypto around 2022 and have since been through every theory out there:
	•	Left-translated cycles, extended cycles, or… no cycle at all
	•	Institutions ruined everything
	•	Alt season is gone forever

Now I’m wondering if I should just take the loss, wait for the next bear market (whenever that comes), and reassess with fresh eyes, probably leaning more into BTC or other promising alts.

So my question is - what’s your honest outlook for ADA at this point?
	•	Do you still think it could return to ATH?
	•	Should I wait a bit longer?
	•	Or if you’re still bullish, what gives you conviction?

They’re an affiliate marketing company a high-margin, capital-light business that generates qualified leads for sportsbooks like FanDuel, DraftKings, and BetMGM. Think “picks & shovels” in the online betting gold rush. They monetize conversions, not bets.

What sets GAMB apart is how methodically they’ve expanded across the U.S. as states legalize online sports betting.
