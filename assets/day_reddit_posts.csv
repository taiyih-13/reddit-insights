When COVID hit,  solution was massive money printing again.  
And it worked. Markets bounced back, the system didn‚Äôt collapse.

Now it feels like every crisis just leads to the same response: **Printing more money.**  
it‚Äôs become a habit. A learned behavior.

And honestly, the U.S. doesn‚Äôt even *pretend* to care about paying down its national debt anymore.  
They just keep rolling it over,, kick the can down the road.

Even this whole push for stablecoins feels like another version of **passing the burden forward** like a digital shell game to absorb more U.S. debt while buying time.

But at the end of the day, who pays for all this?

**Ordinary people who save money.**

  
People who saves consistently through diligently and honestly everyday are getting crushed.

Among contenders for DoD/DPA funding similar to MP materials, they stand out to me as the most mature candidate for heavy rare earth mining/processing. They are the only producer and separator of such products domestically, with competitors attempting to catch up. But they are rather behind.

If I am wrong, the funding will likely go to either USAR, Rameco, or Lynas. We may see more than one beneficiary. But USAR is quite behind. Rameco is lobbying and trying to play catch up, recently opening up a heavy rare earth mine w/ their coal spin. Lynas has ties to Trump via Gina Rinehart. But they are primarily Australian.

This reserve stems from assets seized in criminal investigations and forfeiture cases, and is intended to establish US dominance in digital asset governance while leveraging Bitcoin's scarcity principle.

**Key Points:**

* The government's $24 billion position represents just 0.065% of America's $37 trillion national debt.
* The reserve is currently inactive, with no movement in federal wallets for four consecutive months.
* The policy shift coincides with the passage of the GENIUS Act, creating federal stablecoin regulations.
* Critics question the wisdom of hoarding volatile assets, while supporters hail the reserve as a ""visionary hedge in the digital age.""

There is too much money in circulation. you will be seeing coins and projects with no real use or actual purpose being valued in billions. and i don't think that is normal. It only happens when there is way more money floating around than there should be.

It‚Äôs like the system doesn‚Äôt know where to put all this excess money anymore, so it ends up in random places. And crypto is one of the easiest places for it to land.

But here is what I keep thinking about. What happens if people start cashing out? Not into other coins or digital assets, but into real world things. like Goods, services, property or experiences. Even if just a small percentage of that money flows out of crypto and into the real economy, it could push up prices fast.

The complaint claims Reddit misled investors by hiding that Google Search changes and AI Overview reduced traffic to Reddit.

Sounds fairly legit, at least in terms of visibility

Tesla‚Äôs Model 3 and Model X passed 5 out of 6 highway scenarios  while Chinese competitors like BYD, Huawei‚Äôs Aito, and Xiaomi struggled. Xiaomi‚Äôs hyped SU7 only passed 1 of the 6. While it‚Äôs not full self-driving, it says a lot about system maturity and consistency

Elon even posted about it on X, kind of flexing that Tesla pulled this off without any locally trained data, thanks to China‚Äôs restrictions on data export. He also took a shot at the U.S. for blocking AI model training on Chinese data  classic Elon 

I don‚Äôt think this is some kind of short-term stock catalyst, but it‚Äôs a solid win for Tesla's tech narrative, especially in a market where Chinese brands have been making a lot of noise about their own smart driving features

stocks,Trump expresses support for Musk's development  what does this mean for Tesla and subsidy-related stocks?,FFVIIGuru,16,0.58,34,2025-07-25 13:11:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1m8ys3z/trump_expresses_support_for_musks_development/,"Trump recently posted a message clearly stating that he has no plans to cut Musk's government subsidies, despite recent rumors that he would target electric vehicle subsidies once in office. He specifically said he hopes Musk and all American companies can achieve ‚Äúunprecedented prosperity.‚Äù

Why is this significant?

TSLA has already risen by approximately 12% in July, breaking through the $180-$190 range and approaching the resistance level near $240.

Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) continues to support electric vehicle tax credits and renewable energy subsidies  and the market had already partially factored in the expectation that ‚Äúif Trump were elected, subsidies might be terminated.‚Äù

However, if Trump now states that he is willing to retain these subsidies at least for Musk that would be a clear positive for TSLA bulls.

This could also impact solar, battery, and charging infrastructure stocks like $ENPH, $FSLR, and $CHPT.
