But today, I had a completely fucked up experience while waiting in line at a clothing store’s dressing room in Bangkok. A Thai man, probably around 50 got uncomfortably close to me for no reason. He spoke in Thai, which I didn’t understand, so I said, “Sorry,” in English. He asked if I was Thai, and I said, “No.” Then he asked if I was Khmer, and I told him I’m Burmese. Out of nowhere, he made a threatening gesture, slicing his hand across his neck, saying he’d “behead” me if I was Khmer. Then he went back to the cashier,  and talking about me, bringing up his unhinged threat and mocking me. This was straight-up infuriating, a disgusting attack on my peace for absolutely no reason.

There's endless stories about people recognising fellow Germans on vacation due to them waiting at the traffic lights, or of immigrants getting reprimanded by Germans for not waiting.

I grew up in Germany and am confused by this stereotype because I literally never encounter this. When there's no cars nearby everyone just crosses - unless there's kids around, then most people wait until the light turns green. People obviously don't just run into traffic, but if cars are at a safe distance everyone just crosses the road.

Is it a regional thing? Or more of a suburban thing? (I live in a big city.)

I’m in a bit of a confusing situation and could use some advice. Our landlord recently posted a notice on the building’s main entrance stating that the property has been sold to a new owner and that the change will take effect at the end of this month, which is about a week and a half from now. We were not given any prior notification—just this note on the wall.

I have a few questions:

1. Is it legal for a landlord to make such a significant change without any formal notice to the tenants?


2. Given that the ownership will change, do we have the right to terminate our lease early and move out without any penalties?


3. Are there any other important considerations we should be aware of in this kind of situation?

Hey guys, I hope your weekend is going on well. 

I need to share something bothering me as a married man. I shave regularly, about once every two weeks, and I usually go to shops where, after the haircut, a female staff member washes my hair and gives a head, face, and back massage. I always tip both the barber and the girl doing the wash/massage as a gesture of appreciation. 

However, I’ve noticed a pattern where, after tipping, the girls for some reason they start calling or texting me, asking when I’ll be back for another shave and sometimes saying things like “I miss you,” which makes me really uncomfortable.
It’s gotten to the point where I keep changing barber shops to avoid these situations, but it’s tiring to start over every time. I actually block them as well. 

I have shared this with my wife and I also remember before I got married it never used to happen. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you handle it?

I’m planning a trip to Morocco soon and was thinking of documenting the experience with my camcorder (pic attached). It’s kind of big and old (not flashy or super valuable), but I still want to be careful. I’ve heard some stuff about theft and bag-snatching, especially in busy areas like the medinas in Marrakech or Fès.

Do you think carrying around a bulky camcorder is too risky? Would I be better off leaving it at the hotel most days and only taking it out for specific shoots? Or should I just stick to my phone?

- - - 

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu is monitoring an area of low pressure situated several hundred miles east-southeast of Hawaii.  This system is currently producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms and is gradually becoming better organized.  Environmental conditions appear to be favorable for further development as the disturbance moves westward to west-northwestward this weekend and a tropical depression could form as early as Sunday.

Model guidance suggests that, regardless of development, this system will remain well to the south of the islands throughout the upcoming week.  A second disturbance is likely to move into the region close behind Invest 90C over the next few days, but is also likely to remain well to the south.

# Updates

* **2:00 PM HST** — The potential for this system to develop within the next seven days has increased from 60 percent (medium) to **70 percent (high).**

I’ve been living and working in Germany for a while now. I’ve spent the last two years as a CAE engineer at an automotive company, but due to project cancellations, the department got shut down and now I’m officially in my Kündigungsfrist.

The job market looks really bleak, and honestly, I’m starting to lose hope. I’ve applied to hundreds of positions, and every time I just get rejected without any clear feedback. It’s been demoralizing.

I have 4 years of work experience in total, a mechanical engineering degree, and my German is at B2 level. I thought that would be enough to at least land some interviews, but apparently it’s not. I’m open to working in NRW or Munich. Since I work in simulation, I know I’m not limited to the automotive sector, but it still feels impossible to get through.

If you’re in a similar situation, how are you managing mentally? What helps you stay grounded when the job search drags on and every rejection chips away at your confidence?

We’re a couple renting a villa—looking for natural beauty, charming villages, light hikes, vineyard visits, and a town with some energy for dinners (not into nightlife). Bonus if there’s a discreet nude beach nearby, but not a must.

Definitely not into crowded or overdeveloped areas—looking for space, scenery, and a relaxed vibe. The north seems to have more villa options, but is it too quiet or spread out? Does the south have a better overall feel?

I'll be visiting Milan for the first time (staying three days from the 14th of August) together with my daughter. Looking for some nice activities to do together. Aside from just exploring the city center together and grabbing ice cream every day, are there any sites/museums/activities you can recommend?  
  
Things I looked up already and looked interesting:  
\- Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci (she'll probably be a bit too young, but looks interesting enough for both young and old)  
\- Museo dei Bambini Milano -> A bit unclear to me what it is exactly. Looks like a place to go for school groups and a lot of workshops. Aside from some basic sentences, we don't speak any Italian so if someone visited this museum already and can give some feedback, would be greatly appreciated as well.  
  
My daughter likes to help out in the kitchen a lot whilst we are cooking so I was looking for some cooking class/workshop but all the ones I found have age rest",Itinerary !!MUST PROVIDE TRAVEL DATES!!,,False,False,False,self.ItalyTravel,1m9qkgu,[],places_in_europe,1.0,5.0,6.0,0.5,16.166220163055556,0.9668812192646716,6.40128731558803
