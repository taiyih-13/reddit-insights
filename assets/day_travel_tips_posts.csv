I based myself in Ghent and spent a full day there and did day trips to Bruges, Ypres and Zonnebeke. Ghent was so beautiful, with great food and absolutely stunning architecture.

A few weeks ago, I flew into Denver with just a backpack (around 18 kg / 40 lbs), my Canon DSLR, a foam pad, a cheap tent, and five days worth of food. No car, no hotel, no friends, no exact plan. Just a vague route in my mind: start somewhere in the Front Range, summit a 14er (around 14,000 ft / 4,270 m), maybe two (I was planning Kelso Ridge), and disappear for a while.
And I did. Kinda.

It wasn‚Äôt a clean trip. I ended up on the wrong side of the valley the first day and had to make camp in the rain at almost 12,000 feet (3,660 m).
