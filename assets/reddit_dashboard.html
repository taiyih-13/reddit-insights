i&#x27;ve been holding onto $1000 worth of apple stocks (aapl) and was considering selling it to buy bitcoin. i&#x27;m curious if anyone here has done something similar or has thoughts this a smart move long term.

apple is solid and stable, but not exactly high growth anymore. bitcoin, on the other hand, feels riskier but has much higher upside potential. i&#x27;m in my 20s, so i can stomach some risk and i already have other investments in index funds (voo, etc.)

would love to hear what you ">

it was 💡 moment.

* short interest + surprise move = squeeze fuel
* low iv going in, then boom — iv spike
* delta ramps fast when you go itm
* everyone piles in, market makers hedge, price launches

fury road roars into valhalla, shiny and chrome, as the winner of best movie of 2015, saving us from being inflicted with another mediocre denis villeneuve movie (just kidding guys). hard to argue with this one given that it&#x27;s pretty much the peak of action movie craftsmanship.

well this is a bit of a surprise. i love into the spiderverse but i wasn&#x27;t expecting it to take the win over hereditary and the favourite, or even annihilation. but it is one of the best animated movies of the past decade and has huge widespread appeal so it makes sense as a winner from a popularity standpoint even if it may not be the &quot;best&quot;.

peaky blinders is everything i want in a show — sharp, intense, stylish, and full of bite.

cillian murphy eats every scene. the soundtrack? chef’s kiss.

i already know predestination, primer, time crimes, triangle and at a push you could include time trap and coherence ... ">
