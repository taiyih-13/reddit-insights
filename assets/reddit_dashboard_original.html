                <p><strong>Content Preview:</strong> I see a lot of Theta Gang traders with under 10K accounts attempting to replicate strategies that are not suitable for accounts under 10K, and to extend this, accounts under $25K. In this article, I will share my entire strategy that has made me profitable and consistent.

stock ripped 100% on a short squeeze. cool. it happens all the time.   

but the real juice? the options.  
10 contracts of the 10.5c for $0.12 ($120 total)... they hit $9.20 per contract. that’s over $9k from pocket change.

how? 

* short interest + surprise move = squeeze fuel
* low iv going in, then boom — iv spike
* delta ramps fast when you go itm
* everyone piles in, market makers hedge, price launches 

this is why i mess with options on these setups">

i’m a moroccan female with a naturally skinny body type ,think bella hadid kind of figure.

this isn’t a post fishing for compliments or validation, i promise. i’m just genuinely curious:

are there moroccan guys out there who are attracted to skinny girls too?">

we had our own car, a mitsubishi outlander 4wd with a rooftop tent. and honestly, i’d 100% recommend it. the rooftop tent kept us closer to nature. it just felt right.

i&#x27;ve came back to see what could be done, and the doctor said i needed to extract my tooth, as nothing else was available (unless paying more than 1k€).

so i remove the tooth. but then guess what?! still hurts, and it seems they removed the healthy tooth ">

from the last time: 
the highest denomination when i last visited was 1000pesos. 
now there are 2000 and 10,000 pesos. was easier to carry cash. 
some restaurants gave discount when paid by cash. at least 10%. 

things don&#x27;t seem too cheap. coffee is around 4000-5000 pesos. can be cheaper at a very local places. 
very good food! 

people are friendly and barely came across a cross person.

spent a lot of time in the north">

maybe this post is not in the right place, but i strongly feel the urge to thank the greek authorities for capturing vladimir plahotniuc, the moldovan oligarch who was hiding in a villa in southern athens.

for those who don’t know, this man is one of the main reasons why moldova is the poorest country in europe. he has been involved in human trafficking and drug dealing, and for a long time, through his connections, he controlled every branch of power in the state.

my wife and i are heading back home to the states tomorrow afternoon. our estimated boarding time is 14:00, we have a rental car to return and two bags to check. what is a good time to arrive so we’re not hustling through security in a panic? our typical time is 2 hours at our local airport but i feel we’ll need more time than this. any suggestions are greatly appreciated. 

edit: my apologies for not mentioning heathrow airport, terminal 2 before. that definitely would’ve helped. ">

             data-search-content="
i’ve had a few jobs done around the house lately (plumbing, kitchen repairs, window tinting), and something weird keeps happening: contractors give a quote, do the job, then suddenly the price goes up after they&#x27;re done.

example:

plumber quoted r1200 to install a shower. after finishing, he says he used &quot;too much silicone&quot; and now it&#x27;s r1350.

kitchen guy quoted for a full fix, then added r200 at the end because he &quot;underestimated the work.&quot;
