My standout favorite is Jude Law in ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’. That guy walked, talked, and breathed a Yank as Dickie Greenleaf.

From what I’ve observed over the years, British actors who do really successful American accents tend to come to Hollywood well-prepared and aiming at success.

One reason UK actors have a leg up on American actors is because they often have formal dialect training, which is why many outperform
their American counterparts attempting British accents. I’d go out on a limb to say American actors rarely match that level of authenticity.

The one exception is Forest Whitaker in ‘The Crying Game’. His British accent was so good, I thought the guy was born in the UK( He’s actually from Longview, Texas)  Go figure.  Any other examples of uncanny dialect delivery in a role?

Futurama is back on September 15. The regular phoenix coming out of the ashes again.

Family Guy, yeah it's been on consistently, albeit with a bumpier release schedule than usual. Actually, it doesn't really deserve to be on this list, but it's most recent season has only just ended so it feels fair to include. I personally still need to catch up on the last few.

And South Park has had an inconsistent period since ~2019, and honestly after its delays recently, massive $1.5bn deal, and then the outstanding Trump-baiting episode today, this post may age badly. But what a fantastic return to form today.

Well this is a bit of a surprise. I love Into the Spiderverse but I wasn't expecting it to take the win over Hereditary and The Favourite, or even Annihilation. But it is one of the best animated movies of the past decade and has huge widespread appeal so it makes sense as a winner from a popularity standpoint even if it may not be the ""best"".

Now onto 2017. I feel like Blade Runner 2049 is going to win this one by a good margin, given the demographics of this sub and how much Reddit in general loves that movie. 2017 is a pretty strong year though - we also have Get Out, Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name, Dunkirk and Logan, all of which are pretty well-loved as well. It would be nice to see a truly unexpected win here.

In an absolute shocker of a vote, Parasite is crowned the best movie of 2019. I don't think anyone could have seen this coming, wow. Jokes aside, Parasite lives up to all of its hype and is easily one of the best movies of the past 10 years.

Now onto 2018, which is definitely not as clear-cut. Hereditary, The Favourite and Annihilation will likely be the heavyweights, although I can see Into the Spiderverse and Roma being sneaky dark horses. Who do you got? My personal choice is **Annihilation.**

I personally believe that more than one eyewitness is lying. Besides the two girls in the ship I really don't buy the other stories. What makes me doubt whether she was trafficked or not is her leaving her wallet and shoes behind. A missing pair of shoes would prove she exited the room by her own feet. Usually people don't bring too much shoe wear to a week trip in a ship- mostly sandals and something for the nightclubs. If my sister were missing and she left her shoes behind, I would search in the wardrobe in case she picked another pair of shoes. If this was the case, they would have mentioned it. 

 And if she was promised drugs like the navy said (I personally don't like that guy for a million reasons. Like wdym you didn't report it to extra military authorities asap. He's just, and I apologize for the language, a selfish scum) she would have taken her wallet and ID with her.

With three newcomers failing to make a good impression, ***Superman*** easily kept the top spot for a second weekend with a very solid second weekend drop. ***I Know What You Did Last Summer*** was the top newcomer, but it still wound up below expectations. ***Smurfs*** and ***Eddington*** also flopped, although that's hardly a surprise.

The Top 10 earned a combined $128.7 million this weekend. That's down 11.5% from last year, when ***Twisters*** led with a pretty great $80 million.

***Superman*** was still #1 with $58.4 million this weekend. That represents a 53% drop, which is solid for a comic book film. It's a bit steeper than ***The Batman*** (50.4%), but better than this year's ***Thunderbolts*** (56.4%). And much better than ***Man of Steel*** (64.6%).

I'll start: The Outsider deserved a much larger audience. Based on a Stephen King novel, the acting, the writing and the cinematography are all excellent, resulting in a sort of Stephen King meets Ozark sort of vibe. It's actually scary at times but it's also laced with a quirky sense of humor. Not to mention I'll watch anything with Mare Winningham in it, and she's excellent here. Highly recommended.

One thing stuck with me is realising how much the film is really a comedy. Not overtly, there are no jokes, but the combination of a high brow speaking narrator and the juxtaposition of faces and silences, the use of ellipsis and the musical score, build a dry, existential and very British sense of humour. It helps I've been living in the UK for ten years and have been exposed to it.

It’s not just about taste, though, aesthetically, it does raise eyebrows when you walk into a man’s apartment and see walls plastered with Iron Man posters and shelves lined with Funko Pops. It feels like a missed opportunity. Your space is supposed to reflect your personality, your growth, your evolution. If you’re still decorating like a dorm room from 2012, it begs the question: has there been any growth at all?

Of course, people are free to enjoy what they want. That’s not the point. The point is that superhero obsession often feels less like interest and more like avoidance. It’s escapism dialed to 11. And while a bit of that is healthy in any life, there’s a difference between using it to unwind and using it to fill a void.

A lot of those films are honestly serviceable at best- so I was more than a little surprised to see one in the collection. 

Now the films itself is pretty interesting. In short, it's a tale about an aging dictator and his family facing the consequences of his bloody past, both politically and supernaturally. There have been a number of films based on the legend of La Llorona, but this is one of the few where the titular crying woman isn't a horrifying monster.

Sadly, it seems like they only went nuts on the visuals because the structure, characterisation (if you want to call it that), and third act stuff is all typical 'Marvel' stuff we've seen for the past several years.

As I noted in my own review: ""top quality actors and visual spectacle can only elevate subpar screenwriting by so much, and First Steps can’t overcome the usual Marvel shortcomings of a thinly-drawn villain, little to no actual stakes, and a third act filled with CGI mess.""

Not a bad movie per se, just a very.... serviceable one, but perhaps not the slam dunk or shot in the arm Marvel needs before banking it all on Avengers: Doomsday.

When I mentioned it, she was genuinely surprised to hear there was one - so now I'm here, asking all of you: how do you interpret it?

At first, I took the post-credit scene to mean that our Cinderella figure, Agnes, might not be such a good person after all. It seemed like she left her beloved father's body to rot in that house for decades, maybe longer. That read made her feel complicit in the cruelty of the world around her - someone who used her beauty privilege to survive while turning away from real pain and responsibility. But something about that interpretation didn’t sit right with me.

Peaky Blinders is everything I want in a show sharp, intense, stylish, and full of bite.
Every scene feels cinematic, the pacing is tight, and the characters? Complex AF.

It’s not just a gangster show it’s about trauma, ambition, and power plays wrapped in designer suits and razor hats.
Cillian Murphy eats every scene. The soundtrack? Chef’s kiss.

If you’re into smart, gritty crime dramas like Breaking Bad, Boardwalk Empire, or Narcos this is your next obsession.

I think the core conceit of the movie was that the internet is manipulating ALL of us, regardless of politics, to engage on platforms that profit off of...engagement. 

That wild 3rd act was solidgoldmagikarp as a cartoonsihly evil stand-in for companies like Meta, X, Snapchat, etc. manufacturing more division to keep the unlimited platform engagement flowing. Advertisers pay platforms WAY more if the platforms can show that people don't just passively consume content - they ENGAGE with it. 

The Austin Butler character and the mask virtue signalers were strawmen to illustrate that engagement farming isn't a problem that effects just the right - it targets EVERYONE.

You would think that someone who began as a critically acclaimed international festival/arthouse filmmaker and then became a leading New Hollywood filmmaker would get more discussion in online physical spaces, but that's really not the case.

Content-wise... yeah, I don't think I can fault anyone for being put off by it. It's disturbing and lurid and full of graphic (albeit abstract) depictions of sexual violence, and really straddles the line between feminist sexual liberation and male-gaze-y sexual exploitation.

“Amid the sexual revolution and social upheaval of the early 1970s, acclaimed director Mike Nichols delivered a zeitgeist-defining examination of American mores.

As the women who suffer and see through the friends’ insecure posturing, Candice Bergen, Ann-Margret, Rita Moreno, Carol Kane, and Cynthia O’Neal form an extraordinary ensemble that gives the film its soul.

criterion,No Regrets For Our Youth & One Wonderful Sunday: Two amazing Kurosawa movies you may have missed.,ImmortalIronFist,61,0.98,25,2025-07-19 22:49:51,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m49cyg,"I'm not usually one to start a new thread -- I typically lurk instead of even commenting -- but I really wanted to help spread the word about two early Akira Kurosawa movies that I think are absolutely essential. They both still seem so relevant, even though they are approaching 80 years old. 

**No Regrets For Our Youth** is from 1946, right after the end of WWII, and stars the immaculate Setsuko Hara as a young woman who has her life dramatically changed by the rise of fascism in Japan. It is the best Hara performance I think I've ever seen, and the entire movie was riveting. It may not quite be a five-star masterpiece like what Kurosawa would go on to make -- but it is damn close. Highly recommended! 

**One Wonderful Sunday** is from one year later, 1947. It follows a young couple as they try to enjoy a day to themselves in post-war Japan. The two main actors are SO, SO charming, and there's a scene with kids playing baseball that just left a big smile on my face.

I think they make for some great alternative world building and give way to some unique plot points. Unfortunately, 90% of anime i've seen have handled this disappointingly. Usually, MC is either dragged into or born into a fantasy world, and then the entire world revolves around that MC. MC gets to be the chosen hero, MC gets all the magic powers, MC is capable of doing everything that can be done in that world, and the world basically only exists to be exploited by MC. Nothing about the world has any value in itself, it exists only to move MC's plot forward.

I like when the world building comes first, and then MC just happens to be there. MC is usually better written as a result, because they and those around them actually face challenges. The world just feels more realistic and alive. Some of the shows ive seen that do this better are Berserk, Claymore, Goblin Slayer, Dororo, and Made in Abyss.

Hello guys. I love cinema, I think it's one of the best things to have happened to humanity. I have fallen in love with many different films from different directors.

If you were to ask me about the best film ever made, I would probably point to, ""2001 a Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick. However, my personal favourite is, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" from 1981 by Steven Spielberg.

Now, this is such a great film. It essentially tells the story of an American archaeologist who is trying to prevent the Nazis from obtaining a Biblical artifact that would enable them to become unstoppable.

This movie is such a rollercoaster from start to finish. It opens up in South America, and later moves on to Egypt. The archaeologist has to face various opponents on his path.

I was just curious, how well known is this movie? Is it critically appreciated or not? Do most people know it, and do they like it? What about you?

Like, Spielberg has made many beloved films like Jurassic Park or Jaws or Savi",,1m4yiao,1.5,7.5,262.5,35.0,123.3263367163889,0.7734224534038809,229.27339401851876,Reviews & Discussions,high

She gets all exited about it, until a guy shouts: ""Hey! Ramona!"". Turns out, the people were actually cheering for a woman right behind her (called Ramona). She then proceeds to the bar to get a drink, all bumped out about it, and says a few words.

There's this awesome comic anthology published by **World War 3 Illustrated** called **Now is the Time of Monsters**. The title is plucked from the Italian legend Antonio Gramsci, who wrote:

>“The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.”

Gramsci penned those words while imprisoned by Mussolini’s fascist regime in 1930. The quote later reached English readers through a translation by Marxist scholar Joseph Buttigieg. Yes, *that* Buttigieg, Pete's father.

Gramsci’s words capture a dangerous moment, between the tension of Communism and the spring of unfettered Capitalism, where the future hung in dangerous uncertainty. Hence the ""monster time"".

Bill Duke is left out of the conversation when it comes to leaving a mark on the neo-noir scene, which is a shame because there are some sequences in this film that are simply stunning, and masterful. His use of color (especially in some of the night scenes) are vivid - the use of buzzy neon lights just gets me goin'. And that tracking shot between Goldblum and Fishburne as they walk and talk along a catwalk to an office, and they disappear behind a bookcase, but we stick are tracking them/listening to their conversation - just cool stuff.

I love almost all of Richard Linklater’s films. I've seen most of his movies at exactly the age I should have. When it comes to the Before Trilogy, seeing them when I did changed the way I thought about myself and relationships. 

Before Sunset has always been my favorite.

Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy balance the romanticized version of what happened in the previous movie with the reality of who the characters are 9 years later. They have experienced falling in and out of love, they have started to live their lives and become settled into the people they are. Love, and life, aren't just magical experiences to them any more but they are still able to see the magic in them.

There's this part of a movie I remember where several business people are talking together. It's kind of a throwaway or background scene just to show how shallow they are. Like, there's a fish out of water thing going on here, like it's juxtaposed against a non-business person who is the main character of the movie. 

I think the line I'm thinking of is, ""I could use one of these in my beamer!"" ""We could ALL use one of these in our beamers."" I think it was an air freshener or something. I think the first line is said by a woman and the second by a man and they all start laughing.

I thought it was BIG, but it's not in the script anywhere so I started looking at other places. It's not in American Psycho.

In this forum post from 2007, a discussion is held regarding Stephen Graham's white/Jamaican heritage and several cast/crew from This Is England (2006) contribute (including Shane Meadows himself).

It got me thinking about Death of the Author, and whether the actor's racial heritage is implicit to the character within the text PRIMARILY if it isn't directly addressed in the text itself.

Within the post, it is posited that perhaps the revelation of Graham's race was pre-emptive damage control or attempt to soften criticism (due to difficult themes within the film), whether it's adding too much complexity when having the character Combo be 'just' a Caucasian racist would suffice for the plot.

I feel that this film captures some increasingly modern fears regarding appearances and identity. It truly is a haunting watch that makes you consider a number of different questions; and the two separate storylines of characters here is a wonderful dichotomy that presents the viewer with what are, in my opinion, two oppositions. There is the opposition of perception vs reception, between the story of a man with a scarred face who seeks a prosthetic face mask, and that of a young girl with facial disfigurements on her cheek and neck. The man worries how he will be perceived, and we see how the young is received.
