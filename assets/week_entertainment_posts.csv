From what I‚Äôve observed over the years, British actors who do really successful American accents tend to come to Hollywood well-prepared and aiming at success.

One reason UK actors have a leg up on American actors is because they often have formal dialect training, which is why many outperform
their American counterparts attempting British accents. I‚Äôd go out on a limb to say American actors rarely match that level of authenticity.

The one exception is Forest Whitaker in ‚ÄòThe Crying Game‚Äô. His British accent was so good, I thought the guy was born in the UK( He‚Äôs actually from Longview, Texas)  Go figure.  Any other examples of uncanny dialect delivery in a role?

Tobe Hooper paid for the whole patch as if it was fully grown and ready to sale to have it all removed.

Family Guy, yeah it's been on consistently, albeit with a bumpier release schedule than usual. Actually, it doesn't really deserve to be on this list, but it's most recent season has only just ended so it feels fair to include. I personally still need to catch up on the last few.

Well this is a bit of a surprise. I love Into the Spiderverse but I wasn't expecting it to take the win over Hereditary and The Favourite, or even Annihilation. But it is one of the best animated movies of the past decade and has huge widespread appeal so it makes sense as a winner from a popularity standpoint even if it may not be the ""best"".

Now onto 2017. I feel like Blade Runner 2049 is going to win this one by a good margin, given the demographics of this sub and how much Reddit in general loves that movie. 2017 is a pretty strong year though - we also have Get Out, Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name, Dunkirk and Logan, all of which are pretty well-loved as well. It would be nice to see a truly unexpected win here.

In an absolute shocker of a vote, Parasite is crowned the best movie of 2019. I don't think anyone could have seen this coming, wow. Jokes aside, Parasite lives up to all of its hype and is easily one of the best movies of the past 10 years.

Now onto 2018, which is definitely not as clear-cut. Hereditary, The Favourite and Annihilation will likely be the heavyweights, although I can see Into the Spiderverse and Roma being sneaky dark horses. Who do you got? My personal choice is **Annihilation.**

I personally believe that more than one eyewitness is lying. Besides the two girls in the ship I really don't buy the other stories. What makes me doubt whether she was trafficked or not is her leaving her wallet and shoes behind. A missing pair of shoes would prove she exited the room by her own feet. Usually people don't bring too much shoe wear to a week trip in a ship- mostly sandals and something for the nightclubs. If my sister were missing and she left her shoes behind, I would search in the wardrobe in case she picked another pair of shoes. If this was the case, they would have mentioned it. 

 And if she was promised drugs like the navy said (I personally don't like that guy for a million reasons. Like wdym you didn't report it to extra military authorities asap. He's just, and I apologize for the language, a selfish scum) she would have taken her wallet and ID with her.

With three newcomers failing to make a good impression, ***Superman*** easily kept the top spot for a second weekend with a very solid second weekend drop. ***I Know What You Did Last Summer*** was the top newcomer, but it still wound up below expectations. ***Smurfs*** and ***Eddington*** also flopped, although that's hardly a surprise.

***Superman*** was still #1 with $58.4 million this weekend. That represents a 53% drop, which is solid for a comic book film. It's a bit steeper than ***The Batman*** (50.4%), but better than this year's ***Thunderbolts*** (56.4%). And much better than ***Man of Steel*** (64.6%).

I'll start: The Outsider deserved a much larger audience. Based on a Stephen King novel, the acting, the writing and the cinematography are all excellent, resulting in a sort of Stephen King meets Ozark sort of vibe. It's actually scary at times but it's also laced with a quirky sense of humor. Not to mention I'll watch anything with Mare Winningham in it, and she's excellent here. Highly recommended.

It‚Äôs not just about taste, though, aesthetically, it does raise eyebrows when you walk into a man‚Äôs apartment and see walls plastered with Iron Man posters and shelves lined with Funko Pops. It feels like a missed opportunity. Your space is supposed to reflect your personality, your growth, your evolution. If you‚Äôre still decorating like a dorm room from 2012, it begs the question: has there been any growth at all?

Of course, people are free to enjoy what they want. That‚Äôs not the point. The point is that superhero obsession often feels less like interest and more like avoidance. It‚Äôs escapism dialed to 11. And while a bit of that is healthy in any life, there‚Äôs a difference between using it to unwind and using it to fill a void.

Nothing bloody/gory. This is the main throw-off for him, and I agree. We watched the first episodes of Peaky Blinders, Cowboy Bepop, Da Vinci's Demons, Reacher and a few more, but didn't continue any of them because my dad considered them too bloody. Nothing too violent either (as in, little gore but still everyone dies. My best example for this is the movie The Hitman's Bodyguard. We watched it and it was funny, but afterwards my dad commented on how violent it was).

Nothing overly funny, such as Brooklyn-99. It's not his type of humor.

Nothing Sci-Fi or Fantasy.

There have been a number of films based on the legend of La Llorona, but this is one of the few where the titular crying woman isn't a horrifying monster.

Sadly, it seems like they only went nuts on the visuals because the structure, characterisation (if you want to call it that), and third act stuff is all typical 'Marvel' stuff we've seen for the past several years.

As I noted in my own review: ""top quality actors and visual spectacle can only elevate subpar screenwriting by so much, and First Steps can‚Äôt overcome the usual Marvel shortcomings of a thinly-drawn villain, little to no actual stakes, and a third act filled with CGI mess.""

Not a bad movie per se, just a very.... serviceable one, but perhaps not the slam dunk or shot in the arm Marvel needs before banking it all on Avengers: Doomsday.

At first, I took the post-credit scene to mean that our Cinderella figure, Agnes, might not be such a good person after all. It seemed like she left her beloved father's body to rot in that house for decades, maybe longer. That read made her feel complicit in the cruelty of the world around her - someone who used her beauty privilege to survive while turning away from real pain and responsibility.

Content-wise... yeah, I don't think I can fault anyone for being put off by it. It's disturbing and lurid and full of graphic (albeit abstract) depictions of sexual violence, and really straddles the line between feminist sexual liberation and male-gaze-y sexual exploitation.

They both still seem so relevant, even though they are approaching 80 years old. 

**No Regrets For Our Youth** is from 1946, right after the end of WWII, and stars the immaculate Setsuko Hara as a young woman who has her life dramatically changed by the rise of fascism in Japan. It is the best Hara performance I think I've ever seen, and the entire movie was riveting. It may not quite be a five-star masterpiece like what Kurosawa would go on to make -- but it is damn close. Highly recommended! 

**One Wonderful Sunday** is from one year later, 1947. It follows a young couple as they try to enjoy a day to themselves in post-war Japan. The two main actors are SO, SO charming, and there's a scene with kids playing baseball that just left a big smile on my face.

I think they make for some great alternative world building and give way to some unique plot points. Unfortunately, 90% of anime i've seen have handled this disappointingly. Usually, MC is either dragged into or born into a fantasy world, and then the entire world revolves around that MC. MC gets to be the chosen hero, MC gets all the magic powers, MC is capable of doing everything that can be done in that world, and the world basically only exists to be exploited by MC. Nothing about the world has any value in itself, it exists only to move MC's plot forward.

I like when the world building comes first, and then MC just happens to be there. MC is usually better written as a result, because they and those around them actually face challenges. The world just feels more realistic and alive. Some of the shows ive seen that do this better are Berserk, Claymore, Goblin Slayer, Dororo, and Made in Abyss.

# Intro. Dispelling the 3yr Rumour + Castle details:

The Infinity Castle first appeared in Episode‚ÄØ26, the finale of Demon‚ÄØSlayer Season 1. However, the 3D model built for that episode was not used at all in Demon‚ÄØSlayer:‚ÄØInfinity Castle - Akaza‚Äôs Return.

To bring the Infinity Castle Arc to life on the big screen, the staff likely proposed a creative vision for a more expansive and densely detailed version. This is easy to imagine after seeing the visuals in the current work, but another practical issue arose.

Assuming all visual assets were already completed, the Infinity Castle is rendered in 3DCG (a process called rendering). Calculations sh",Discussion,1m4roy2,1.0,5.0,319.0,0.061224489795918366,127.87411449416666,0.7661292381999468,244.39522698578304,Reviews & Discussions,high

Hello guys. I love cinema, I think it's one of the best things to have happened to humanity. I have fallen in love with many different films from different directors.

If you were to ask me about the best film ever made, I would probably point to, ""2001 a Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick. However, my personal favourite is, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" from 1981 by Steven Spielberg.

Now, this is such a great film. It essentially tells the story of an American archaeologist who is trying to prevent the Nazis from obtaining a Biblical artifact that would enable them to become unstoppable.

This movie is such a rollercoaster from start to finish. It opens up in South America, and later moves on to Egypt. The archaeologist has to face various opponents on his path.

I was just curious, how well known is this movie? Is it critically appreciated or not? Do most people know it, and do they like it? What about you?

Like, Spielberg has made many beloved films like Jurassic Park or Jaws or Savi",,1m4yiao,1.5,7.5,262.5,35.0,123.3263367163889,0.7734224534038809,229.27339401851876,Reviews & Discussions,high

There is this TV show that I want to know its name (I'll share the reasons at the end). I haven't actually seen the show, just a commercial for it, where it showed a scene of the show. The scene goes as follows:

A woman (presumably the protagonist or one of the protagonists of the show) enters a bar. As soon as she steps in, the people in there start cheering. She gets all exited about it, until a guy shouts: ""Hey! Ramona!"". Turns out, the people were actually cheering for a woman right behind her (called Ramona). She then proceeds to the bar to get a drink, all bumped out about it, and says a few words. I don't remember what she says, but I believe it was something funny, since the show looked like it was a sort of funny sitcom.

Just to clarify, the ""Ramona"" character didn't seem important, just a random secondary character, the important thing was that the protagonist woman got happy people were cheering for her, just to find out it was for someone else.

There's this awesome comic anthology published by **World War 3 Illustrated** called **Now is the Time of Monsters**. The title is plucked from the Italian legend Antonio Gramsci, who wrote:

>‚ÄúThe old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.‚Äù

Gramsci penned those words while imprisoned by Mussolini‚Äôs fascist regime in 1930. The quote later reached English readers through a translation by Marxist scholar Joseph Buttigieg. Yes, *that* Buttigieg, Pete's father.

Gramsci‚Äôs words capture a dangerous moment, between the tension of Communism and the spring of unfettered Capitalism, where the future hung in dangerous uncertainty. Hence the ""monster time"".

Bill Duke is left out of the conversation when it comes to leaving a mark on the neo-noir scene, which is a shame because there are some sequences in this film that are simply stunning, and masterful. His use of color (especially in some of the night scenes) are vivid - the use of buzzy neon lights just gets me goin'. And that tracking shot between Goldblum and Fishburne as they walk and talk along a catwalk to an office, and they disappear behind a bookcase, but we stick are tracking them/listening to their conversation - just cool stuff.

Basquiat was the title I'd most been looking forward to out of this pair. I have a DVD copy of Straight No Chaser but I'd never owned a copy of Basquiat until now.



Neither of these were blind buys. I have watched them many, many times. Both films were my introduction to the artists.

We‚Äôd love something that‚Äôs:

* Somewhat procedural (cases or story arcs that wrap up in an episode or two)
* Funny with some heart
* Has action or suspense to keep things moving
* Appropriate enough for tweens/teens (a little edge is fine, but not full HBO)

I love almost all of Richard Linklater‚Äôs films. I've seen most of his movies at exactly the age I should have. When it comes to the Before Trilogy, seeing them when I did changed the way I thought about myself and relationships. 

Before Sunset has always been my favorite.

Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy balance the romanticized version of what happened in the previous movie with the reality of who the characters are 9 years later. They have experienced falling in and out of love, they have started to live their lives and become settled into the people they are. Love, and life, aren't just magical experiences to them any more but they are still able to see the magic in them.

There's this part of a movie I remember where several business people are talking together. It's kind of a throwaway or background scene just to show how shallow they are. Like, there's a fish out of water thing going on here, like it's juxtaposed against a non-business person who is the main character of the movie. 

I think the line I'm thinking of is, ""I could use one of these in my beamer!"" ""We could ALL use one of these in our beamers."" I think it was an air freshener or something. I think the first line is said by a woman and the second by a man and they all start laughing.

I thought it was BIG, but it's not in the script anywhere so I started looking at other places. It's not in American Psycho.

In this forum post from 2007, a discussion is held regarding Stephen Graham's white/Jamaican heritage and several cast/crew from This Is England (2006) contribute (including Shane Meadows himself).

It got me thinking about Death of the Author, and whether the actor's racial heritage is implicit to the character within the text PRIMARILY if it isn't directly addressed in the text itself.

Within the post, it is posited that perhaps the revelation of Graham's race was pre-emptive damage control or attempt to soften criticism (due to difficult themes within the film), whether it's adding too much complexity when having the character Combo be 'just' a Caucasian racist would suffice for the plot.

The man worries how he will be perceived, and we see how the young is received.
