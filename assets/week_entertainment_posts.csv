My standout favorite is Jude Law in ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’. That guy walked, talked, and breathed a Yank as Dickie Greenleaf.

From what I’ve observed over the years, British actors who do really successful American accents tend to come to Hollywood well-prepared and aiming at success.

One reason UK actors have a leg up on American actors is because they often have formal dialect training, which is why many outperform
their American counterparts attempting British accents. I’d go out on a limb to say American actors rarely match that level of authenticity.

The one exception is Forest Whitaker in ‘The Crying Game’. His British accent was so good, I thought the guy was born in the UK( He’s actually from Longview, Texas)  Go figure.  Any other examples of uncanny dialect delivery in a role?

Easily the best film I've seen this year. I was fortunate enough to only see one trailer one time so I went in pretty blind. Which always makes a movie better in my opinion. I'm not sure what I was expecting going into this, as a large fan of Days and Weeks, the films are so different that I knew I wouldn't necessarily have to worry about continuity that is present in other franchise films. This movie made me cry, not just shed a tear, sob. This movie was beautiful crafted and I am genuinely interested to see what they do moving forward. There were some unorthodox things that happened, but those things made this film something original in a genre that uses the same template over and over

I'm looking for the kind of movie where things get stupidly serious, or at least have a stupidly serious subplot.

It may or may not contain: protagonists saving the day because everyone else is brainless; comic-relief characters whose jokes don't lend but somehow you do laugh; dumb decisions; dumb deaths; bizarre/old CGI; mind-blowing camera angles & plot resolutions; or other wacky things.

I'm mostly interested in movies with vibes like in *Deep Blue Sea (1999)*, *Druids (2001)*, and *Volcano (1997)*. It can be a live-action, an animation, or even a TV series if this Subreddit will allow it.

Never has a TV show reached so deeply into my soul and altered my life. There are no words)
But, how about some lesser known selections?
I'll start: The Outsider deserved a much larger audience. Based on a Stephen King novel, the acting, the writing and the cinematography are all excellent, resulting in a sort of Stephen King meets Ozark sort of vibe. It's actually scary at times but it's also laced with a quirky sense of humor. Not to mention I'll watch anything with Mare Winningham in it, and she's excellent here. Highly recommended.
2) Looking. Yet another series cancelled way before it's time.

I personally believe that more than one eyewitness is lying. Besides the two girls in the ship I really don't buy the other stories. What makes me doubt whether she was trafficked or not is her leaving her wallet and shoes behind. A missing pair of shoes would prove she exited the room by her own feet. Usually people don't bring too much shoe wear to a week trip in a ship- mostly sandals and something for the nightclubs. If my sister were missing and she left her shoes behind, I would search in the wardrobe in case she picked another pair of shoes. If this was the case, they would have mentioned it. 

 And if she was promised drugs like the navy said (I personally don't like that guy for a million reasons. Like wdym you didn't report it to extra military authorities asap. He's just, and I apologize for the language, a selfish scum) she would have taken her wallet and ID with her. In many trafficking operations victims are asked to bring along such documentation, especially cash money.",Discussion,1m803tg,[],1.2,6.0,1822.0,2.264,64.50657583555557,0.874250177806071,1775.0838239626614,Reviews & Discussions,high

One thing stuck with me is realising how much the film is really a comedy. Not overtly, there are no jokes, but the combination of a high brow speaking narrator and the juxtaposition of faces and silences, the use of ellipsis and the musical score, build a dry, existential and very British sense of humour.

I also rewatched the Ocean’s trilogy this week and the new original Ocean’s Eleven is almost 25 years old. But when you watch it it doesn’t seem like a product of its time. It could have been made a month ago and probably would look mostly the same.

It’s not just about taste, though, aesthetically, it does raise eyebrows when you walk into a man’s apartment and see walls plastered with Iron Man posters and shelves lined with Funko Pops. It feels like a missed opportunity. Your space is supposed to reflect your personality, your growth, your evolution. If you’re still decorating like a dorm room from 2012, it begs the question: has there been any growth at all?

Of course, people are free to enjoy what they want. That’s not the point. The point is that superhero obsession often feels less like interest and more like avoidance. It’s escapism dialed to 11. And while a bit of that is healthy in any life, there’s a difference between using it to unwind and using it to fill a void.

A lot of those films are honestly serviceable at best- so I was more than a little surprised to see one in the collection. 

Now the films itself is pretty interesting. In short, it's a tale about an aging dictator and his family facing the consequences of his bloody past, both politically and supernaturally. There have been a number of films based on the legend of La Llorona, but this is one of the few where the titular crying woman isn't a horrifying monster. It's a subtle, haunting horror adjacent film with dense atmosphere, and no over reliance on jump scares.

Sadly, it seems like they only went nuts on the visuals because the structure, characterisation (if you want to call it that), and third act stuff is all typical 'Marvel' stuff we've seen for the past several years.

As I noted in my own review: ""top quality actors and visual spectacle can only elevate subpar screenwriting by so much, and First Steps can’t overcome the usual Marvel shortcomings of a thinly-drawn villain, little to no actual stakes, and a third act filled with CGI mess.""

Not a bad movie per se, just a very.... serviceable one, but perhaps not the slam dunk or shot in the arm Marvel needs before banking it all on Avengers: Doomsday.

I think the analyses that talk about the AI data center looking over the city, built on stolen land, miss WHY SolidGoldMagikarp was chosen as its title. For those explanations, it very well could have been titled ""EvilAICompany"" and that analysis would remain unchanged. I think Ari Aster is pointing to something more specific, though the stolen-land take is valid and not mutually exclusive to that which I present below.  
  
**I promise this all rounds back to Eddington!**

I think they make for some great alternative world building and give way to some unique plot points. Unfortunately, 90% of anime i've seen have handled this disappointingly. Usually, MC is either dragged into or born into a fantasy world, and then the entire world revolves around that MC. MC gets to be the chosen hero, MC gets all the magic powers, MC is capable of doing everything that can be done in that world, and the world basically only exists to be exploited by MC. Nothing about the world has any value in itself, it exists only to move MC's plot forward.

I like when the world building comes first, and then MC just happens to be there. MC is usually better written as a result, because they and those around them actually face challenges. The world just feels more realistic and alive. Some of the shows ive seen that do this better are Berserk, Claymore, Goblin Slayer, Dororo, and Made in Abyss.

There's this awesome comic anthology published by **World War 3 Illustrated** called **Now is the Time of Monsters**. The title is plucked from the Italian legend Antonio Gramsci, who wrote:

>“The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.”

Gramsci penned those words while imprisoned by Mussolini’s fascist regime in 1930. The quote later reached English readers through a translation by Marxist scholar Joseph Buttigieg. Yes, *that* Buttigieg, Pete's father.

Gramsci’s words capture a dangerous moment, between the tension of Communism and the spring of unfettered Capitalism, where the future hung in dangerous uncertainty. Hence the ""monster time"".

Hello guys. I love cinema, I think it's one of the best things to have happened to humanity. I have fallen in love with many different films from different directors.

If you were to ask me about the best film ever made, I would probably point to, ""2001 a Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick. However, my personal favourite is, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" from 1981 by Steven Spielberg.

Now, this is such a great film. It essentially tells the story of an American archaeologist who is trying to prevent the Nazis from obtaining a Biblical artifact that would enable them to become unstoppable.

This movie is such a rollercoaster from start to finish. It opens up in South America, and later moves on to Egypt. The archaeologist has to face various opponents on his path.

I was just curious, how well known is this movie? Is it critically appreciated or not? Do most people know it, and do they like it? What about you?

The scene goes as follows:

A woman (presumably the protagonist or one of the protagonists of the show) enters a bar. As soon as she steps in, the people in there start cheering. She gets all exited about it, until a guy shouts: ""Hey! Ramona!"". Turns out, the people were actually cheering for a woman right behind her (called Ramona). She then proceeds to the bar to get a drink, all bumped out about it, and says a few words. I don't remember what she says, but I believe it was something funny, since the show looked like it was a sort of funny sitcom.

Just to clarify, the ""Ramona"" character didn't seem important, just a random secondary character, the important thing was that the protagonist woman got happy people were cheering for her, just to find out it was for someone else.

Bill Duke is left out of the conversation when it comes to leaving a mark on the neo-noir scene, which is a shame because there are some sequences in this film that are simply stunning, and masterful. His use of color (especially in some of the night scenes) are vivid - the use of buzzy neon lights just gets me goin'. And that tracking shot between Goldblum and Fishburne as they walk and talk along a catwalk to an office, and they disappear behind a bookcase, but we stick are tracking them/listening to their conversation - just cool stuff. And the conversation between Fishburne and the cop (reverend) under the deep red neon lights is just mesmerizing. If this film were to be remade today, lord knows it would have that gray/dark blue washed out look that modern films have now.

I'm making it a habit to appreciate at least one technical aspect of every film I watch, and in Apocalypse Now, that was the sound. I have never experienced such incredible sound mixing in any film until now, and to think that the film is from 1979. Absolutely breathtaking. You hear only what is necessary. No more, no less. And the music. Haunting.

Would anybody be interested in making a youtube-channel, where we put together a group of people from different european countries to discuss a movie?



I have been making some podcasting and some shorter youtube clips/recommendations for some while now, but all in my native danish language. I got an idea about making a more international channel, because with all the content I cant remember seing one where people got together across borders to discuss a certain movie, and I thought that the idea of getting different perspectives in that way could be interesting. I say european, because that would be the easiest in terms of scheduling, but I am not totally ruling out that it could be broader.



The rough draft as follows:



\- There should be an episode about once a month (we are busy people, lets be honest)



\- We choose a movie to watch and discuss, could be anything from a classic silent movie from the 1920's to some small arthouse production from your own country (no ",,1m9qeab,[],2.0,10.0,156.0,2.142857142857143,15.434631391111111,0.9683560083820871,166.6635373076056,Lists & Rankings,high

Violet Evergarden, Kaguya-sama Love is war, Sonny boy, Given, Sasaki to miyano (I'd watch any BL to be honest), Psycho Pass, Evangelion, Tonari no kaibutsu-kun, Blue period (the manga>>>), Tokyo sinks 2020, Devilman Crybaby, Stars Align, Eresed, Magi (but ",What to Watch?,1m5166k,[],0.8,4.0,138.0,2.066666666666667,148.46518694666668,0.7339587338906078,115.08630527690389,Recommendation Requests,high

(2019) 100min on Shudder, AMC+, and Philo

Loving young couple Kate and Matt move into a secluded mansion and discover a strange secret room whose interior holds the power to make everything they want a reality. From millions of dollars to material riches, whatever they want instantly materializes. One day, she decides to ask the room to grant them the child they haven't been able to have. But their initial happiness from this blessing will have unforeseen consequences. As they say: careful what you wish for.

**Possible Spoilers**

A modern “Twilight Zone” movie that I quite enjoyed. The concept was very interesting with some twists along the way. It’s got some trippy sci-fi and cosmic horror themes. The origin of the room was left unknown as I wish we got a little more answers.

I didn't like it at all. It was very strange/weird but not in a good way. I was later very surprised to read that this movie won a lot of awards and also was France's official submission to many competitions.

What am I not getting? Yes the protagonist had a very messed up childhood that shaped the rest of her life. She was very un emotional after the first violent encounter. I thought she was maybe just emoitanlly numb from her childhood. But then, why did she tell her friends over dinner about what happened? She seemed to enjoy the encounters afterwards. Why did she fight the antoginist in the final scene? Was that time different? Was she happy her son killed him? Whats the point of her son raising a son that is obviously not his?

There's this part of a movie I remember where several business people are talking together. It's kind of a throwaway or background scene just to show how shallow they are. Like, there's a fish out of water thing going on here, like it's juxtaposed against a non-business person who is the main character of the movie. 

I think the line I'm thinking of is, ""I could use one of these in my beamer!"" ""We could ALL use one of these in our beamers."" I think it was an air freshener or something. I think the first line is said by a woman and the second by a man and they all start laughing.

I thought it was BIG, but it's not in the script anywhere so I started looking at other places. It's not in American Psycho. 

The movie is American and set in the 80s. I distinctly remember shoulder pads. I probably saw it in the 80s or 90s. I want to say Paul Reiser was in it, but I can't say for sure.
