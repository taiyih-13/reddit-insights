Was out in the Grand Tetons dodging bears and overpriced bison burgers this week when I saw a local Wyoming news story on Ramaco Resources $METC. They just opened the Brook Mine on July 11 2025. First new rare earth mine in the US in over 70 years

CEO was on the news talking about how their rare earth deposit is easier to access than $MP. Said the material is in softer ground and they‚Äôre going to do processing onsite instead of shipping it overseas

He even compared it directly to $MP which already has deals with Apple and the DOD. That‚Äôs the kind of narrative that made $MP rip. And now the Pentagon is sniffing around Wyoming too

It's not some guy getting out of prison.  The recent wallet had BTC at 37 pennies.  That wasn't some underground dollars changing hands.

No one held that long- that was at least 7-10 years they could have been living like a millionaire.

We don't think there is a quantum computer that could run the calculation, though that day approaches closer and we don't see all the developments.  People think they would go after banks, but if you can only crack one code every 45 days, and the rule is if you have the key, you are the owner, then that's the best and least risky target out there.

Revenue is down 12 percent year over year.

This is the important lesson on Tesla. It was a great story many years ago. People thought Elon was all that mattered.

The stock is at the same price it was in 2021. It has gone nowhere for four years.

I made a statement in our 24/7 community right after the earnings release. I said we are going to wake up 10 to 20 years from now and Tesla will still be below its current all-time high. Or if it happens to make a new all-time high in the near future, it will not surpass the one it hit at the end of the last bull market.

It is not a software company. It is not a tech company. It is a car company. 90% of its revenue comes from cars. Go to the Tesla website. That is what it is.

This strategy was developed to exploit specific forced market mechanics that effectively put extreme sell pressure on stocks during specific time windows.  


This strategy is the convertible note strategy.  It goes like this:

1) Company issues a press release announcing a convertible note issuance.

2) Go and check the filing.  There will be an exhibit 99.1 as an attachment.  Read this, and look for a pricing window (if not already price)  This pricing window is generally a VWAP during a small timespan on the next trading day.  If the filing is release in the pre-market, it will be that same day.  Here is the recent filing from MARA on Wednesday.  It mentions 2pm through 4pm EST.

The Port of Los Angeles says that shipping container traffic has increased as importers race to beat the latest deadlines set by President Trump for tariffs.

Trade from China, while short of a Covid-like surge, has been up ahead of the mid-August deadline for a deal which could raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%.

The Port of Los Angeles reported its best June ever for shipping container traffic, an increase in ocean freight that port executives described as a tariff whipsaw effect, with shippers racing to beat President Trump‚Äôs trade taxes, especially a mid-August deadline for tariffs on Chinese goods.

A total of 892,340 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were processed at the Port of Los Angeles in June, containers that were filled with holiday season and consumer replenishment products.

My work contributes 18% of my pay to my 401k. So I will max out my portion this year, and my work is contributing the other ~48k to max the total 401k limits. When I max out the 401k, the 18% just rolls into my paycheck as overage. 

So next year I‚Äôd still looking at 50-55k contributed to my 401k without adding anything myself.

In a key shift, recent changes to environmental laws, particularly under the Trump administration, are set to weaken the demand for these credits. Essentially, regulatory credits have been a way for automakers who make gasoline-powered cars to avoid hefty fines for not meeting pollution standards. Companies like Tesla, which sell electric vehicles (EVs), have been able to make a nice profit by selling these credits to help the likes of GM, Ford, and Honda meet emissions targets.

But now, with the U.S. eliminating fines for automakers who fail to meet certain emission targets, the need for these credits is in sharp decline. Analysts are already slashing their forecasts for Tesla‚Äôs credit revenue, with some predicting it could fall by 40% in 2025 and hit rock bottom by 2027.

Most importantly both cloud AND AD revenue was up significantly showing no results of decline to ChatGPT.

The stock declined in afterhours for a brief moment because CAPEX increased from 75>85B but when Google explained that the demand for cloud and AI is so big they cannot service it! **Demand is outpacing their supply!!**\>> Simple terms - Google upped their investment to keep up with crazy demand! In fact Google announced on the earnings call they have a **backlog of 109B!!!**

**What this means**\> AI and (Cloud) Datacenters are growing even harder than expected! Giving a very bullish signal to all those involved including semiconductor companies that recently taken a beating. 

Nothing shows more resolve than adding another 10B in such volatile times, clearly showing or perhaps re-confirming that AI is the just not a hype word.

**My assumptions**

I tried to estimate Alphabet‚Äôs fair value using both a P/E multiple approach and a discounted cash‚Äëflow (DCF) model. 

|Assumption|Low|Mid|High|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Earnings per share (starting point)**|**$5.5**|**$7.4**|**$8.0**|

|**Discount rate**|**14¬†%**|**12¬†%**|**10¬†%**|

My growth assumptions are lower than Alphabet‚Äôs recent 14¬†% revenue growth because I don't think Google can sustain >20¬†% EPS growth over a decade. I am also very worried about the DOJ forcing  major changes to Google‚Äôs search business - and this is beyond the risk that ChatGPT/OpenAI are causing.

Over the past two months, Incannex 
Healthcare ($IXHL) has been on an absolute tear ‚Äî up more than 300%, and surprisingly, very few are talking about it. Here‚Äôs why this move may be just the beginning and not just a pump:

‚∏ª

üî¨ 1. Clinical Trial Breakthrough ‚Äì IHL-42X

IXHL announced the completion of patient dosing in its Phase 2 trial for IHL‚Äë42X, a novel treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This is a huge milestone that positions the company for Phase 3 trials and potentially regulatory approval.

In June, they also finalized a ‚Äúdatabase lock‚Äù, which signals that results are now being prepared for analysis ‚Äî a major catalyst for any biotech stock.

‚∏ª

üìä 2. Massive Trading Volume

Trading volume recently exceeded 150 million shares in a single day ‚Äî a staggering number for a low-float micro-cap. This spike in volume suggests growing institutional interest or speculative accumulation ahead of potential news.

I understand that paying off the entire debt and closing the cards could hurt my credit score.

So an old neighbor maybe 80s.. gifted me $25,000 Iraqi Dinar and told me to sign up on 
""DINAR RECAPS NEWSLETTER"" and to contact them to open a bank account and they will tell me when to deposit the money because they will exchange it for ""gold"" and they will also tell me when i can corvert that to money. He said this is worth 100k USD and he wants to help my husband and I to buy a house. 

Y'all I cried because he is so kind hearted but also I got a little sad he lost his wife about a year ago. In my head I was like ""this sounds too good to be true"" and well... I came across many reddit post talking about this scam.

How should I break it down to him this is a scam? Maybe I should just keep the bill somewhere to remember my kind hearted neighbor?

I‚Äôm not going all in or anything, but I started building a position. If you‚Äôre already diversified, having some exposure to a name like $UNH at these levels feels like a smart long-term bet. This is the kind of stock that doesn't stay cheap for long.

However, Silver is not even at all time highs. It has faded away from the concept of being an economic hedge (Gold is still king here).

I was burning through challenges quickly, treating it more like gambling than trading. Instead of stepping back to analyze my mistakes, I kept pushing forward, as if I were playing a video game‚Äîrestarting every time I failed, only to repeat the same errors.

Eventually, I hit a wall. I could no longer afford to buy new challenges, and that forced me to reflect. I had failed most of my challenges with 5ers and FTMO. My strategy was primarily scalping 15-minute to 1-hour setups, which didn‚Äôt align well with my Pacific Time Zone. My trades typically lasted around 30 minutes.

Most of which were dumb mistakes, that were easily fixable.

Trading has a way of breaking you down mentally. Not just from losses, but from the illusion that you're supposed to be perfect.

You‚Äôre not. None of us are.  
And chasing perfection is probably the fastest way to blow your account, your confidence, and your passion for the craft.

One of the hardest lessons I‚Äôve had to learn (and re-learn) is that losing days are part of the job.  
Not a sign that you‚Äôre a bad trader.  
Not a sign that your edge is broken.  
Just‚Ä¶ part of the game.

You‚Äôre running a business. And businesses have expenses.  
**Losses are your expenses.**

But social media doesn‚Äôt show you that part.  
You see traders post 30 straight green days and think ‚ÄúDamn, what am I doing wrong?‚Äù

Here‚Äôs the truth:  
A lot of those ‚Äúgreen days‚Äù started red.  
Then they oversized. Got lucky.  
And called it a win.

üìò The Little Book That Beats the Market ‚Äì Key Ideas

1. Mr. Market offers prices daily‚Äîirrational in the short term, but right in the long run.


2. Stock prices can swing ¬±50% yearly, while business value changes ~5‚Äì10%.


3. Buy great businesses (high ROIC) at cheap prices (high earnings yield).


4. The Magic Formula = Rank by ROIC + Rank by Earnings Yield ‚Üí Buy top stocks.


5. The formula uses last year‚Äôs numbers‚Äîgood enough on average.


6. Avoid predictions‚Äîuse real, historical data instead.


7. Avoid micro-caps (< $50M market cap)‚Äîtoo risky and illiquid.


8. The strategy may underperform for 2‚Äì3 years‚Äîstay patient.


9. Over any 3-year period, the formula has historically beaten the market.


10. Use a margin of safety‚Äîbuying cheap protects against being wrong.


11. Own at least 20 stocks to reduce volatility.


12. With sector diversification and your own filtering, 8 stocks may be enough.


13. It‚Äôs better to own 5‚Äì8 stocks you know well than 30 you don‚Äôt.

Logged into Fidelity this morning and realized that we (F39; M40) ticked over the $5mm milestone today. 

I am a M&A partner at a midsized law firm. She is a physician assistant. We have two kids in a VHCOL area.

- $700k in 401k (wife)
- $3mm in brokerage account (VOO/QQQ; a few single stocks (less than $500k in aggregate))

Neither of us come from money. My parents and I left China in 1990 shortly after Tiananmen Square. My dad borrowed $200 from his college professors.

Next-generation heirs are also driving the adoption of cryptocurrencies, pushing for digital diversification and embedding it into succession and estate planning.

I have an abusive person from my life who I have cut off completely. But because they are still in contact with a family member, they periodically send me gifts and sometimes money. Usually when I get a gift or check, I will just rip it up and throw it out.

But last year they sent me a cashier's check for a reasonable sum. Some family members told me that they won't know if I cash it or not, so I might as well take the money. I went to the bank that issued the check, and asked the teller before cashing it whether the person who issued the check will know if I cash it? She seemed like she didn't fully understand my question and just said, ""Oh yeah, sure!""

I ripped the check up and left. But to be honest, she sounded like she was just saying whatever she thought I wanted to hear. So I don't trust what she said.
