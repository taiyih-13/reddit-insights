It seems like the excitement around Bitcoin has changed. ETFs have quietly built up huge holdings. Big companies have started keeping Bitcoin in their reserves without making noise about it. Even hotel chains and smaller businesses have joined in, silently buying in the background. But regular people mostly stood by, unsure if even $60K was already too expensive.

It feels like big institutions finally figured it out. They didn't talk loudly or create hype.. they just quietly bought Bitcoin. Most regular investors didn’t even notice.

My biggest onetime buy was when BTC was around $13,000. It felt like a lot back then, and I had no idea what was coming. (0.5 BTC)
My only real regret is not buying more during the dips or sometimes not buying at all out of fear. There were times I froze when prices dropped, and that hesitation probably cost me the most.

But here’s what I’m proud of:
✅ I’ve never sold a single sat. Not once.
✅ I bought at both lows and highs, and I’m still here.
✅ I plan to keep stacking. Slowly. Steadily. With conviction.

This 1 BTC isn’t just a number, it’s a milestone. A reminder of everything I’ve learned, every doubt I’ve overcome, and every late-night rabbit hole I’ve gone down.

Now it feels like every crisis just leads to the same response: **Printing more money.**  
it’s become a habit. A learned behavior.

And honestly, the U.S. doesn’t even *pretend* to care about paying down its national debt anymore.  
They just keep rolling it over,, kick the can down the road.

Even this whole push for stablecoins feels like another version of **passing the burden forward** like a digital shell game to absorb more U.S. debt while buying time.

But at the end of the day, who pays for all this?

I’ll start:
I got into crypto in 2017 as literally the entire top 50 was starting to run (IIRC ETH to $50-70). My trade thesis was simple: “what hasnt pumped yet?” did about a days worth of research and subsequently dumped $20k into XRP. First got in about $10k in at 0.006 cents and it pumped to like 7cents a week later. Bought another $10k on the retrace back to 2.5cents. 

Held thru the 2018 short lived pumped to $3. Didnt sell a penny. Blockfolio said $6mm.

Held thru all the way until SEC sued Ripple and that shook me to the core. Couldnt hodl after that and sold. I still came out in significant profit from my initial capital.

wallstreetbets,408K -> 800K YOLO INTO IOVA AND WHY THIS IS JUST THE START,backwardsfrog,1637,0.89,651,2025-07-23 09:29:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m74nu8/408k_800k_yolo_into_iova_and_why_this_is_just_the/,"**TLDR: IOVA's current rise marks the very beginning of a year-long short squeeze. Both the technical and fundamental set-up (34.5% short interest) makes this one of the best opportunities I have seen in a very long while. A price target of 10-15$ is very achievable.**

Two months ago I posted a 408K YOLO into IOVA with ten points of DD (I highly recommend you read this if you haven't already as I outline the basics of the company + main theses there): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k\_yolo\_into\_iova/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k_yolo_into_iova/)

Since then, the stock has risen over 80% on multiple positive updates and my position grew to 800K (after I also added \~12k shares). I believe that a few recent developments, however, are so substantial that they warrant a new post, and my conviction in the stock has never been higher.

**Fundamentals are improving rapidly - much faster than sell-side and shorts expected:**

I had this one regular customer who was buying a lot of hardware from me. For one sale, which came to $1,500, he asked if he could pay me in something called ""Bitcoin."" I'd never heard of it and it sounded sketchy, so I turned him down and asked for cash.
He offered to pay in Bitcoin for several other sales after that, and I refused every single time. Looking back, given the amount of gear he was buying, he was almost certainly using the laptops for BTC mining.
At the time, that $1,500 payment would have been about 5 BTC.

Today, those 5 BTC would be worth over.... Never mind

That being said I believe Trump provides for easy ways to print money, and I'm going to try to get mine before the country comes crashing down.

Fundamentally, I think this administration pushes big policy. Policy that is capable of making or breaking industries. This administration also openly grifts and engages in quid quo pro on an unprecedented level. I believe that by taking advantage of these 2 patterns, we can make a ton of money.

To boil it down, I think that by being on top of administration policy, specific relevant dates regarding policy, bills, etc, we can find some big winners and losers. In terms of grift, being aware of companies with connections to the admin is also highly beneficial.

Was out in the Grand Tetons dodging bears and overpriced bison burgers this week when I saw a local Wyoming news story on Ramaco Resources $METC. They just opened the Brook Mine on July 11 2025. First new rare earth mine in the US in over 70 years

CEO was on the news talking about how their rare earth deposit is easier to access than $MP. Said the material is in softer ground and they’re going to do processing onsite instead of shipping it overseas

He even compared it directly to $MP which already has deals with Apple and the DOD. That’s the kind of narrative that made $MP rip. And now the Pentagon is sniffing around Wyoming too

Meanwhile $METC is a coal company that already has strong cash flow. They’re not some cash burning startup hoping to maybe dig a hole. They’re mining now and using profits to fund this rare earth pivot

Meme stock short squeeze, people piling into stocks with little revenue that have already 10x in the past year, because of hype about future revenue (not mentioning any names, but they're spammed endlessly, I think you can guess).The exact same sentiment about EVs in 2021. The trend was inevitable, yet so many EV shitcos have gone bust since then. 

IPOs in hot industries, ie.Circle and Coreweave at outrageous market caps after going straight to the moon.

Ultra high yield ETFs. Eg. ULTY, MSTY. Testing the limits. It used to be people were happy with a 5% yielding stock paid quarterly. Now people are piling into 110% yield ETFs, and paid weekly!

\-Bad earnings (INTC, TSLA, DOW) are actually getting shit on, while good earnings results (GOOG, NOW) are only resulting in moderate rises

\-Every recent candle has long tails from drawdown before ending slightly up

Value Proposition: SBET is raising $5 billion to buy ETH, holding 280,706 ETH ($840M at $3,000/ETH) and purchasing ~14,931 ETH/day. They could complete their target by December 2025, owning ~1.67M ETH.

Almost immediately, I started getting calls and texts from debt collectors, always for a woman I had never heard of. I don’t remember the name now, but the calls were relentless. At first it was polite messages asking her to call back. I would tell them, “I just got this number. I don’t know who that is.” But the calls didn’t stop. They intensified. Over the next few years, I started getting messages saying it was my “final opportunity to settle before a lawsuit.”

Then, in 2019, five years into this, I get a call from a very professional-sounding young woman who says she’s a paralegal calling on behalf of a law firm to collect on a recent legal judgment. I asked for her full name and the law firm, repeated it back, and wrote it all down. Then I calmly said:

Seems like Powell is getting hammered only because of Trumps insistence on lowering the rates. Powell otherwise has been highly regarded in how he's handled the economy (outside of the early mistake of ""transient inflation"" but he's otherwise navigated what everyone was assured would be a recession with masterful class).  
Getting back to El-Erians comment though, Powell resigning so Trump can appoint someone who will do his bidding seems to be the exact opposite of ""preserving Fed independence"".  What am I missing here?

I’ve searched emails to see if I did something dumb and emailed it to myself. I didn’t but an email was sent to a friend one day after creating the volume saying I gambled all my bitcoin away. I almost gave up assuming it would be empty. A couple weeks ago I found an old keepass password file used around the same time. I couldn’t remember that password until today. Sitting at a light in my truck the light bulb in my head went off. I’m thinking to myself, is that the password? I got home and tried it and sure enough I got into the keepass database and inside it had the true crypt volume password. I couldn’t believe I still had 1.3 bitcoin in there.

I'm a U.S. citizen and work full-time in the trucking industry, earning about $60,000/year.

Back in 2019, I used profits from trading stocks to help buy a house in my home country in the Caribbean. I put down about $130,000 cash and took a mortgage for the remaining ~$130K. It was actually my mother’s idea—she had plans around the property too, but sadly, she passed away a year later. That’s part of why the property means something to me, but at the same time, it hasn’t been a great financial move since then.

Right now, that home is worth around $425,000, and I still owe about $130,000. I’ve been renting it on Airbnb, but after mortgage, HOA fees, utilities, housekeeping, and management, I only make around $600/month profit, and even less in off-seasons. It’s been stressful to manage remotely, and there’s added pressure now—my HOA has threatened to shut down Airbnb rentals, s",Housing,1m5fybq,0.8,4.0,1846.0,0.327909887359199,108.24848812055556,0.7981029470022076,1657.8980401660751,Personal Trading Stories,medium

The most creative part of Satoshi's invention was arguably the addition of the difficulty adjustment to ensure that the Bitcoin supply schedule would stay on track even in the face of changing mining hashrate due to high Bitcoin demand or an abundance of energy. It's a mechanism that sets Bitcoin apart from most other supply/demand systems.

Tesla has been facing rising competition in key markets like China and Europe, especially from lower cost Chinese EV players. In early July, Tesla reported a 14% year-over-year slide in vehicle deliveries to 384,000 for the second quarter.

Previous cycles did not have an ETF. Previous cycles didn't have a President that just acquired an additional $1B in btc and holds $2B.  Previous cycles didn't have Wallstreet on board and advisors starting to pitch BTC allocation to their >9 figure AUM ultra high net worth clients.

Realized market cap needs to be \~2T for btc to be valued @ $1MM.

The current global M2 is \~100T, and is projected to double over the 10 years. You're telling me we're going to get another $100T of fiat in the world, and you don't think *at least* another 1T is going into btc?

Given the ETF, given the BTC treasury companies, given that it is now a Wallstreet asset, it is 100% obvious we're going to get at least another trillion USD into bitcoin over the next 10 years.

From the last week of June, I started focusing only on the London session. Fewer trades, less time on charts, and more focus. That worked better. My account was down -6%, but I slowly recovered and reached +3% last week.

The only thing which matters is market direction.

Only buy LEAPS when Fear and Greed index tanks to 25 or below.

(LEAPS with 70+ delta ideally of high beta companies.)

Only sell LEAPS when Fear and Greed index pushes 65-75.

Whether prices keep running afterwards it's all noise.

When VIX spikes take positions. When VIX floors sell positions.

The hard part is being patient. The easy part is buying. The hard part is selling. Waiting as market keeps pumping, feeling missing out because prices are moving. Prices are actually irrelevant. Underlying is simply a vehicle with greater or lesser returns of market participation. The goal is to participate in market booms, avoid market dumps, and actually compound gains.

Checking my balance I'd found that Auburn had drafted the remainder of my tuition straight from my checking account instead of waiting for my grant to clear (I guess I had agreed to that when signing up for classes).  My parents weren't supporting me.  I was standing there, looking at $1.76 in my bank account.  I walked over and told the cashier I'd have to leave the cart, and she picked up a pack of ramen and raised an eyebrow.  I dunno how much a pack of ramen cost back then but it was enough.  I went home, microwaved my ramen and drank a few shots of ~~varnish remover~~ my roommate's bottle of evan williams green label, and waited a few days for my SSI disability check to clear.

\* NUC-3373 (solid tumors w/ pembrolizumab & docetaxel) – additional results coming late 2025

➡️ FDA guidance coming after expansion.

Even modest results = big upside.

Trade from China, while short of a Covid-like surge, has been up ahead of the mid-August deadline for a deal which could raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%.

The Port of Los Angeles reported its best June ever for shipping container traffic, an increase in ocean freight that port executives described as a tariff whipsaw effect, with shippers racing to beat President Trump’s trade taxes, especially a mid-August deadline for tariffs on Chinese goods.

A total of 892,340 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were processed at the Port of Los Angeles in June, containers that were filled with holiday season and consumer replenishment products. The increase in containers was not a surprise after President Trump l",Industry News,1m623ir,2.0,10.0,1003.0,0.16145833333333334,93.06071034277778,0.8237596488747264,826.2309278213506,Market News & Politics,high

For 15 years, I worked as an independent contractor and never really thought about retirement, investing, or the future at all.

Over the last couple of years, I put some money into Nvidia and moved it over Tesla and managed to build up about $75K. That’s more money than I’ve ever had at once, but I know it’s nowhere near enough for real financial security or retirement.

Honestly, I feel out of my depth handling this amount, and I don’t want to be reckless with it. At the same time, I’d like to use it as a starting point to build something bigger. Given where I’m at in life, what would be some smart ways to put this money to work and start preparing for the future?

In a key shift, recent changes to environmental laws, particularly under the Trump administration, are set to weaken the demand for these credits. Essentially, regulatory credits have been a way for automakers who make gasoline-powered cars to avoid hefty fines for not meeting pollution standards. Companies like Tesla, which sell electric vehicles (EVs), have been able to make a nice profit by selling these credits to help the likes of GM, Ford, and Honda meet emissions targets.

But now, with the U.S. eliminating fines for automakers who fail to meet certain emission targets, the need for these credits is in sharp decline. Analysts are already slashing their forecasts for Tesla’s credit revenue, with some predicting it could fall by 40% in 2025 and hit rock bottom by 2027.

GOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.

I started trading crypto in 2018. Like many, I got in with zero experience, thinking I’d get rich fast. Spoiler: I didn’t.

Bought TRX, XRP, and a bunch of random altcoins. Lost $2,700 in a few months. Then I tried margin trading (big mistake), got liquidated, and was left staring at an empty account. Honestly, I almost quit.

In 2019, I decided to stop gambling and start learning. I studied charts, watched real traders, read books, and backtested strategies. I didn’t trade real money for a while—just practiced and journaled everything.

By 2020, I was finally making small profits. Took only setups I trusted, avoided hype, and managed risk properly. Made around $4,800 on a $3K account. Nothing crazy, but it felt earned.

This company is still being valued like a high growth tech darling, when in reality, it is little more than a subprime auto loan originator cloaked in aggressive, misleading accounting practices.

Today, Oppenheimer, a firm that once stood for integrity in research, raised its price target on Carvana, projecting a 40 percent upside. In doing so, they have effectively trampled on the legacy of their own past.

What happened to the spirit of Steven Eisman and Vincent Daniels, who once sat in that very research department and dared to challenge consensus, who believed in asking uncomfortable questions, who fought to arm the little guy with the truth, even when it cost them access or popularity?

Over the past two months, Incannex 
Healthcare ($IXHL) has been on an absolute tear — up more than 300%, and surprisingly, very few are talking about it. Here’s why this move may be just the beginning and not just a pump:

⸻

🔬 1. Clinical Trial Breakthrough – IHL-42X

IXHL announced the completion of patient dosing in its Phase 2 trial for IHL‑42X, a novel treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This is a huge milestone that positions the company for Phase 3 trials and potentially regulatory approval.

In June, they also finalized a “database lock”, which signals that results are now being prepared for analysis — a major catalyst for any biotech stock.

⸻

📊 2. Massive Trading Volume

Trading volume recently exceeded 150 million shares in a single day — a staggering number for a low-float micro-cap. This spike in volume suggests growing institutional interest or speculative accumulation ahead of potential news.

1. The premise of the company is flawed: For those of you who don't know, Opendoor is a real estate company which was the first to introduce the concept of iBuying to the housing market. The concept of having an algorithm evaluate the property prices by accounting for number of bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities, future value projections, and local housing market trends sounds enticing at first... if it wasn't for the fact that it has proven to be highly ineffective.

**Key Points:**

* The government's $24 billion position represents just 0.065% of America's $37 trillion national debt.
* The reserve is currently inactive, with no movement in federal wallets for four consecutive months.
* The policy shift coincides with the passage of the GENIUS Act, creating federal stablecoin regulations.
* Critics question the wisdom of hoarding volatile assets, while supporters hail the reserve as a ""visionary hedge in the digital age.""

Over the past few years, Netflix has vanquished the likes of Walt Disney, [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), and Apple in the battle to become the top videostreamer. Yet it’s slipping behind the company that has emerged as its biggest competitor: Alphabet’s YouTube.



This was hammered home on Thursday when Netflix reported second-quarter results. It earnings per share surged 47%. And according to Nielsen, its share of U.S. viewers remained at 8.3%—almost twice as high as all of the Disney channels combined.



The problem: YouTube’s share of U.S. viewers grew to 12.8% from 9.9% a year earlier.

Trading is the hardest thing I have ever done. I'd like to think of myself as a level headed person, but the problem is that trading exposes your emotions and your thought process as an individual.

Yet surprisingly, this hasn’t really shown up in the broader economy or stock market *yet* — I’ll admit that. But I think it’s because people don’t tend to price in these risks until they hit hard and fast such as decrease **housing prices** or increase **unemployment rate**.

Meanwhile, the macro picture is getting shakier:

* The U.S. is running a **7% deficit** — *during* good times
* **Tariff uncertainty** is rising again, which could hit global trade
* **Higher interest rates are sticking around longer** than many expected
* The **crypto space feels frothy again** — a lot of bank earnings MA, trading IPO is currently driven by Crypto craze
* **Layoffs are increasing**, and **job openings are shrinking**

personalfinance,Will paying off my 4k in CC debt all at once be bad or should I do it in chunks?,Broil-Man,57,0.71,132,2025-07-23 19:01:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1m7hz86/will_paying_off_my_4k_in_cc_debt_all_at_once_be/,"I have just under $4kin debt spread across four different credit cards. I've been ignoring it and only making minimum payments for too long. Recently, I came into an $18k inheritance and plan to set aside $10k for a house fund, as I intend to buy in the near future. The remaining $8k will go toward paying off my credit cards and establishing a small emergency fund.

I understand that paying off the entire debt and closing the cards could hurt my credit score. If I open a new card for recurring bills and recurring payments like subscriptions, would that help offset the hit? Or would it be more beneficial to pay the cards off gradually, in medium increments like $500 a month, focusing on one card at a time until they’re all paid off?

\--EDIT--

So my general incentive here is to 0 out debt and save the 170ish dollars in minimum payments towards savings. the goal is not to raise the credit score but hurt it as little as possible.

However, Silver is not even at all time highs. It has faded away from the concept of being an economic hedge (Gold is still king here).

Stock is down over 20% from its highs and trading at a forward P/E it hasn’t touched in years. Not saying it’s risk-free, but at this valuation? It’s hard to ignore.

I’m not going all in or anything, but I started building a position. If you’re already diversified, having some exposure to a name like $UNH at these levels feels like a smart long-term bet. This is the kind of stock that doesn't stay cheap for long.

So an old neighbor maybe 80s.. gifted me $25,000 Iraqi Dinar and told me to sign up on 
""DINAR RECAPS NEWSLETTER"" and to contact them to open a bank account and they will tell me when to deposit the money because they will exchange it for ""gold"" and they will also tell me when i can corvert that to money. He said this is worth 100k USD and he wants to help my husband and I to buy a house. 

Y'all I cried because he is so kind hearted but also I got a little sad he lost his wife about a year ago. In my head I was like ""this sounds too good to be true"" and well... I came across many reddit post talking about this scam.

How should I break it down to him this is a scam? Maybe I should just keep the bill somewhere to remember my kind hearted neighbor?

With all this crypto hype dragging in fresh blood again, here’s a little guidance to help avoid screwing yourself over.

* **Hold that shit**: If you actually believe your coin’s got long-term value: **JUST HOLD**. Ignore the noise and don't sell unless some *real* bad news drops (Key partners exit, serious exploit, insolvency, lost legal challenges, etc). Even then, the price will likely climb back up unless it's some irrecoverable problem or it was just a rug-pull crypto in the first place.
* **Do some damn research**: Look up reasons why your crypto of choice has value, what its downsides are, etc. Is it because Logan Paul hyped it up, or is it because the team behind it have are *actively* and *visibly* working on a bigger plan? Find that shit out first before putting money in it.

 In such a monetary environment, hyper-speculative excesses are quickly exposed and forced to confront the market's real-time preferences. The market is guided by a real rate of return aligned with real interest rate. Consequently, even speculative growth stocks are expected to eventually turn a profit or be forced out of the capital market. Capital is indeed scarce, and conservatism is the name of the game. 

This is not at all the environment we see today. 

Sound economic calculation is almost impossible since  every single aspect of the pricing ecosystem is speculative and untrustworthy. It is all a giant casino of uncertainty that benefits Wall Street’s tendency towards securitization.

At the top of Finviz you already have a screener, and you are going to use it to choose specific criteria (the ones you want), in my case:

* **Exchange**: first NASDAQ, then NYSE.
* **Price**: maximum I usually put 10 dollars, but if what you want is only pennystocks, select 5 dollars.

This move, funded through their at-the-market (ATM) offering (~$3.6M), significantly reduces dilution risk and helps clean up the capital structure.

🔹 Why this matters:
	•	These warrants were issued just a couple months ago (May 2025), so taking them off the table now shows urgency to restore investor confidence.
	•	This follows their planned 1-for-200 reverse ADS split, part of efforts to maintain Nasdaq compliance and reframe the stock’s optics.
	•	Biotechs often suffer from overhang issues — NCNA is actively working to eliminate those.

📊 Price action:
	•	Stock rallied ~7% intraday, and after-hours showed another ~13% spike.
	•	Could see a technical breakout if volume holds this week.

💡 The setup:
	•	Tiny float, penny-level pricing, short interest rising, and now less dilution risk.

Canadians increased their net position in US stocks by $14.2 billion in May, more than 4x the volume last year. It was 88% higher than the previous cycle peak in May 2021, and the biggest net increase for the month on record. Only 6 months in the past 37 years of data have seen larger net increases just one prior to 2020, and most within the past two years. 

May net investment in US stocks was typically minimal often negative prior to 2020. Pulling out of volatile American markets and reallocating the capital into Canadian investment properties was nearly a national pastime.

A bit of context: I bought $ASTS back when it was trading at just over $3. People laughed at me, told me it was vaporware, and that satellite-to-cell was science fiction. Look where it’s at now. I’m not saying NVTS is the same kind of play, but I am seeing that same kind of overlooked potential.

So what’s the deal with NVTS?

Navitas designs and manufactures gallium nitride (GaN) power ICs. If you’re not familiar, GaN is what a lot of industry experts are calling the “next-gen” material for power electronics.

I journaled every day. I reviewed every single trade, even the ones I didn't take. I spent time each weekend analyzing my performance : what I did right, what I did wrong, and what I needed to adjust. That process alone kept me grounded.

📘 The Little Book That Beats the Market – Key Ideas

1. Mr. Market offers prices daily—irrational in the short term, but right in the long run.


2. Stock prices can swing ±50% yearly, while business value changes ~5–10%.


3. Buy great businesses (high ROIC) at cheap prices (high earnings yield).


4. The Magic Formula = Rank by ROIC + Rank by Earnings Yield → Buy top stocks.


5. The formula uses last year’s numbers—good enough on average.


6. Avoid predictions—use real, historical data instead.


7. Avoid micro-caps (< $50M market cap)—too risky and illiquid.


8. The strategy may underperform for 2–3 years—stay patient.


9. Over any 3-year period, the formula has historically beaten the market.


10. Use a margin of safety—buying cheap protects against being wrong.


11. Own at least 20 stocks to reduce volatility.


12. With sector diversification and your own filtering, 8 stocks may be enough.


13. It’s better to own 5–8 stocks you know well than 30 you don’t.

It feels like every major trend gets hyped to death these days - AI, renewable energy, demographic shifts, etc. But I'm curious what themes or secular changes you think the market is still sleeping on or significantly undervaluing.

A few that come to mind for me:

Infrastructure decay/replacement cycle. The amount of bridges, roads, water systems, and power grids that need massive overhaul in the next decade is staggering, but most infrastructure plays still seem reasonably valued compared to tech darlings.

Nearshoring/friendshoring. Everyone talks about it, but I don't think the market has fully grasped how much manufacturing will actually move closer to end markets over the next 5-10 years. Supply chain resilience is becoming a strategic imperative, not just a cost optimization.

Water scarcity. Climate change gets attention, but water specifically seems underappreciated relative to how acute this problem is becoming globally.

He specifically said he hopes Musk and all American companies can achieve “unprecedented prosperity.”

Why is this significant?

TSLA has already risen by approximately 12% in July, breaking through the $180-$190 range and approaching the resistance level near $240.

Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) continues to support electric vehicle tax credits and renewable energy subsidies  and the market had already partially factored in the expectation that “if Trump were elected, subsidies might be terminated.”

However, if Trump now states that he is willing to retain these subsidies at least for Musk that would be a clear positive for TSLA bulls.

This could also impact solar, battery, and charging infrastructure stocks like $ENPH, $FSLR, and $CHPT.

When Netflix sells off at earnings, the forward returns for 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks has always underperformed the baseline in the past. That is not to say those forward returns are negative. The 2m S&P median is over 1%. It means that it returns lower than any randomly-selected normal mean/median window. 

In terms of actual trades, this is difficult, because volatility is very low. Short volatility not great. The netflix selloffs portend a very high amount of volatility for the stock itself.

So I was wondering if anyone out there would be kind enough to explain how they go about finding winning stocks in the market. Im looking more for general direction and wisdom, and not looking to rip off anyone's strategy.

Generally, I like to dig around in sectors I find interesting, like tech, aerospace, biomedical devices, etc, but I feel I miss a lot of good opportunities because my net isn't cast wide enough or I'm too busy reading the SEC filings for company X.

He's also a good salesman talking his book, im sure he's had alot of meetings gathering cash for more purchases. He currently owns 226,722 shares of BMNR, noting his comitment to the companys goal.

Looking for Cheap Stocks? Healthcare Shares Haven’t Looked This Good in 30 Years. - Barron’s 

By  Andrew Bar
July 21, 2025

Healthcare stocks now are at their cheapest level relative to the overall market in 30 years following a tough first half for former industry leaders such as UnitedHealth Group, Merck , and Pfizer.

That could offer opportunities, since growth-oriented investors who once gravitated towards healthcare have pivoted to other sectors, notably technology, industrials, and even electric utilities.

The portfolio strategy team at Goldman Sachs ranks the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 index by absolute and relative price/earnings ratios.

Healthcare stocks now trade for 16 times forward earnings, compared to 30 for technology and 22 for the S&P 500 index. Most sectors are cheap versus their 10- and 30-year averages relative to the S&P 500 index, but health",Basics / Getting Started,1m62awy,1.0,5.0,338.0,0.6582278481012658,92.89626589833334,0.8240419111762336,312.326165977567,Analysis & Education,medium

Enrollment will be impacted but I don’t think that that impact will be that large, membership count has been growing for years because they are a good insurance (41% more members in just one year) and people will always need a health insurance.

They’ve had problems with profitability because their margins are low (which is normal in that sector) but now when they have more and more member that is less and less of a problem (proof of that is that they were profitable last quarter).

Their financials are stable as they have more than five billon dollars in assets while only having a market cap of around 3 billion.

I was making 55k-75k in the years prior. I just got married and my wife makes $60,000 a year. My wife thankfully has 0 debt to her name. 

I recently in the last year paid off around $30,000 in high interest consumer debt. Lots of overtime and sacrifices made to do that but it was totally worth it.

1.  Possible government contract

CEO (**Pierre Schürmann**, who owns 16.22% of the company shares) said that they're close to signing a BIG deal with a public agency in Brazil. When that turns official, the price could spike
