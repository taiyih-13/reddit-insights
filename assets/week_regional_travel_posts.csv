We camped at Big Run South – Site 019 off Big Run Rd near Blackwell. It’s a primitive site in the PA State Park system, but beautifully maintained with a solid fire ring, a downed log for seating, and easy access to the creek just steps from camp. I arrived with everything organized in bins—cooking gear, sleeping, food, bike stuff—to make setup smooth and reduce stress. I use a Snow Peak Alpha Breeze tent (which I absolutely love), and paired it with an Exped LuxeMat Duo so my son and I could sleep on one massive mattress together. Slept like a rock both nights. I also brought a Dometic water jug and faucet system, which turned out to be a lifesaver for cooking, cleaning, and getting him ready for bed without hassle.

When they told the restruant staff about this, they denied it and when they told the staff there weren't going to pay for it they got agressive and demanded pay. Eventually they settled on an amount to pay, (I think it was half) and left. I then posted this review on google, just stating that there were maggots in food and they made us pay.

(meaning other people). I realize that it may not be the wisest idea to hike alone, but I take as many precautions as I can. (Telling people where I plan to go, proper clothing, concealed weapon where allowed etc). I have a few friends that go with me, who claim they are into hiking, but they do nothing but complain the entire time, or they are talking on their phone half the time. We don't go for long hikes. If it were miles and miles I could understand. But it's frustrating, because it takes away from what is supposed to be a fun experience and time spent together. I don't mean to throw myself a pity party, so I apologize if it comes across that way, but today was my final straw. Being alone on the trail, listening to nature, being alone with my thoughts.... it's the only way I can enjoy it. Does anybody else feel this way?

I am from Hungary, so not a stranger to horrid political landscape. 

So, Alice Weidel, leader of AfD, is openly gay and is in a long-term same-sex partnership with someone born in Sri Lanka. This seems to stand in a big contrast to the AfD’s political opinion, which is known for being anti-immigrant, having traditionalist views on family, and alignment with far-right nationalist ideologies. Given these contradictions, how does she address this? How is this perceived by the public and AfD supporters?

The full hike is around 10km round trip on a fairly well maintained private road/trail (it can be muddy in the rain) make sure to wear good hiking shoes and dress appropriately for the weather, you can check the forecast at [vedur.is](http://vedur.is) 

Also be mindful of the wind direction as there is smoke and toxic gas coming from the volcano so if the wind is blowing in the direction of the hiking path it is not recommended to do the hike especially if you have asthma or any other health complications or if you are a child or an elderly person.

Supongo que un brindis al sol.

Estoy deprimido con los precios de inmobiliarios. Por mucho dinero que uno gane, cualquier casa en propiedad está por encima del medio millón.

Con un salario dentro de la media, es imposible adquirir nada. Si tomamos el salario medio, o mediano, que da igual, se necesitan al menos 20 años para adquirir una propiedad de este estilo. Suponiendo que no se gasta nada en comida, transporte u otros conceptos.

Cómo se puede vivir así? La generación anterior compraba una casa en pocos años con salarios normales. En mi pueblo, la peluquera amiga de mi madre tiene un chalet que hoy día vale más de un millón de euros. Aun cuando uno viaje al extranjero para trabajar muchos años y ganar más dinero, es imposible financiar nada.

After a half mile or so, i realized that this guy and i were hiking at the same pace. Which... was kind of annoying. I dont want to have to feel rushed with someone behind me. So i stopped to let him pass me. When i did this, he also stopped and took a drink... which was annoying. But whatever. I waited a few moments and continued on.

**Day 1:** Started from Yosemite Valley with a drive up to Tuolumne Meadows, took ESTA to Mammoth, then Reds Meadow shuttle to Devils Postpile NM. Late 5 PM trail start meant a short first day just getting far enough outside Devils Postpile to legally camp.

**Day 2:** Easy day to Minaret Lake with plenty of time to explore the shoreline off-trail. Highly recommend taking extra time here - the lake is stunning and offers great opportunities for discovery.

**Day 3:** The adventure began! Hiked from Minaret Lake toward Cecil Lake and beyond. The route from Cecil to Iceberg Lake is barely a trail - just snow, boulders, and scree with full packs. Challenging but rewarding as we made our way to Ediza Lake where the established trail resumed. Camped at Garnet Lake.

3 of us came into the Napoli station looking to take an Uber to the airport since we had luggage with us. We were sadly a bit tight on time, but everything was going as planned. 

My basic understanding of Uber here is that it does not operate like Uber in the United States. It is government regulated(?) as basically another way to book a taxi. And Uber Black as a ‘private driver.’

We booked an Uber Black and we were waiting for it on the curb. A few taxi people came up offering rides but we were wary since they were not ordered through FreeNow/Uber, therefore risking issues with the fare. And again, we had ordered the Uber Black already. 

Well the Uber Black driver pulls up and immediately the two “nice” taxi people that had offered us rides get in front of the car after we had put the luggage in and got in the car.

When there's no cars nearby everyone just crosses - unless there's kids around, then most people wait until the light turns green. People obviously don't just run into traffic, but if cars are at a safe distance everyone just crosses the road.

I’m in a bit of a confusing situation and could use some advice. Our landlord recently posted a notice on the building’s main entrance stating that the property has been sold to a new owner and that the change will take effect at the end of this month, which is about a week and a half from now. We were not given any prior notification—just this note on the wall.

I have a few questions:

1. Is it legal for a landlord to make such a significant change without any formal notice to the tenants?


2. Given that the ownership will change, do we have the right to terminate our lease early and move out without any penalties?


3. Are there any other important considerations we should be aware of in this kind of situation?

My dad was getting dizzy and sat down on a side street and had a mini stroke. Eyes blank and body shaking. He has issues with low blood sugar and cholesterol issues and wasn’t drinking water. A random Italian man came by to check on him and ask if we wanted him to call an ambulance for us. His symptoms subsided and he was alert again, and he insisted he was fine.

Consider instead that a better approach would be to write posts that focus on the behavior rather than the specific people involved. Such posts would have educational value: for every shaming post I’ve seen there are almost always multiple people who comment that they weren’t previously aware of the issue. This education is a good thing.

If you do make an educational post, consider the following:

Is a photo really needed to make your point? If it is, then obscure any faces. 

How familiar are you with Iceland? Are you qualified to make this observation?

Consider using the RespectfulTourism flare.

I don’t remember exactly where I first heard about this, but through experimenting, I found a trick that could be a lifesaver if you’re nearsighted and lose your glasses.

If you ever end up in a situation where you can’t see anything beyond arm’s length, try this: make a tiny hole with your index finger by pressing it against the big knuckle of the same finger (the MP joint). Look through that hole with one eye, and you’ll notice that things suddenly look sharper. It’s not perfect, but it’s enough to make out shapes, read something up close, or spot your lost glasses.

This works because of the pinhole effect, which helps focus light better. If you need both hands free, you could also poke a few small holes in a leaf, cloth, or a piece of bark to get the same effect.

Not sure if this is common knowledge, but I figured I’d share in case it helps someone. It’s especially useful if you’re very nearsighted.",,,False,False,False,self.hiking,1m7jtuv,[],adventure_travel,1.0,5.0,417.0,0.19248826291079812,82.11458917833333,0.8427608412729596,351.4312708108242

Just needed some advice regarding a doctor bill that I received recently. 

So, this was my first visit to a doctor after living 3 years in Germany. I am publicly insured by SBK. What happened was I cut my hand on a Friday afternoon and thus wanted to get a Tetanus shot. On Saturday, I just went to a private practice booked via Doctolib (no phone call involved) and got my vaccine shot there. I paid by cash at that time, around 152 euro,s as they don't accept public insurance. In this 152 euro bill, the doctor charged the same consultation by phone for the same reason, for not speaking German. But I just paid without any question. As I didn't have any vaccination card, the doctor told me to come next week and collect the card. So I left in good faith.

I went to the doctor next week on 28 June without any termin as they said it was not necessary for collection. After visiting, we talked for 4-5 minutes, and they mentioned that they had forgotten to make it, but then they s",,,False,False,False,i.redd.it,1m7ojqq,[],european_travel,1.0,5.0,352.0,2.3214285714285716,78.961255845,0.8483155374563816,333.8070691846463

In response, Thailand has recalled its ambassador from Phnom Penh, summoned the Cambodian ambassador in Bangkok, closed certain checkpoints near the disputed area, and preparing further diplomatic retaliation

Yesterday I rented a MILES XL van to transport some stuff in Berlin. After the trip, I noticed the fuel was low (\~17%) and there was a gas station right next to where I was parking to end the ride, so I decided to refill. There’s also a €5 credit if you refill when the fuel is below 25%, so I thought, why not.

Unfortunately, I picked the wrong fuel, “Super” (petrol) instead of diesel. I realised it almost immediately and stopped fueling within a few seconds. I did not start or move the vehicle afterwards. I called MILES emergency support right away and they ended the ride remotely and said it would be towed from gas station later. They mentioned I might be charged for towing, pump cleaning, and a handling fee. But the agent wasn't sure about cost and protection plus insurance.

Their terms and conditions online say:

**> Wrong refueling: €150**. Additional costs for damages and towing services may apply.

The view was incredible. The sleep? Not so much.

Somewhere between “this is genius” and “this is a terrible idea,” I realised hanging 6 meters up in a creaky hammock while the forest below came alive at dusk maybe wasn’t the most relaxing choice. 😅

Same trip, different forest: found some seriously fresh bear tracks. Not close enough to panic… but close enough to feel very small.

Anyway – it was one of those weird-but-wonderful setups you remember for a long time. What was your most unusual or memorable camp spot this year?

I'm thinking about visiting Mexico and can't find anyone who wants to come along. So, after several years with this on my mind, I am considering to go out there alone.

My interests are post punk, independent art, history, archeology, jungles and also Mexican culture and of course the cuisine.
I'm German and we get very little exposure to Mexico over here and what there is, is mostly via the US. So I'm really interested in experiencing the real deal.

I've seen this community's wiki has some cool and useful resources, so I thought I'd ask a more general question about where to go.

Mexico city seems obvious, I guess, but also pretty huge and maybe overwhelming to visit alone. 
I've read that Guadalajara also has a cool rock scene and seems more manageable to visit for a week or 2.

I am wondering if it is safe to travel on overnight buses as a solo female traveler? Flights to Cappadocia are almost the same price, therefore if the buses (or the bus terminals at night) are even a little unsafe, I would opt for flights.

Is it safe to go to a bus terminal at night in Istanbul, Göreme or Antalya? Is it safe to wait at the bus terminal at night (the buses I checked would leave between 7 pm and 11 pm)?

Please ask whatever questions you have, someone will answer.

Directly from [this very important site](https://safetravel.is/driving/top-12-tips/), here are some basics:

1. **All passengers are required to wear seatbelts at all times**
This applies to the back seat also as they are no safer than the front seats. 

2. **No stopping in the middle or on the side of the road for photos**
Find a safe spot to stop. Many accidents have occurred when tourists stop at an unsafe spot to admire the view or take pictures. 

3. **Choose your speed according to conditions weather & road**
The speed limit applies to the best conditions and in winter conditions are seldom so good that you can drive according to the speed limit. 

4. **Slow down when approaching gravel roads.**
The tires will lose grip when crossing from paved roads to gravel. Not slowing down can make you lose control of the car.

Just wondering who’s investing in what exactly.

I came across a brief on another €500 billion spending for upgrading infrastructure. This is not the same as €630 above. It’s exciting times ahead as Germany really plans to spend more in upgrading infrastructure as well as creating more jobs and boosting economy.

I decided to gack at camping after a couple years, so I bought a tent, it is really small. It's this one : [2-Person Camping Tent, MH 100 - Quechua - Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.ca/en/p/8957937/camping-tent-2-person-mh-100). I think it's too small so I might go back to the store to ask for a bigger one, if they accept.

I went for a one-night camping trip last night. This morning, the interior of the flysheet was really wet. I don't know if it's coming from the condensation of my breathing or the moisture in the air. All my gear that I left outside yesterday was wet this morning : my jug of water, my chair, and my car too, so I assume the air was really moist.

Anyway, that was not a problem this morning, I packed and gone home, where I can dry everything.

But what if I stay more than one night, or if I have to pack for an other camping site ? How to dry the tent ?

I was curious as to whether how realistic it would be to take solo weekend trips to new cities. 

For example, would flying out on a Friday night and flying back in on a Sunday (because we still have bills to pay and limited PTO lol) be feasible?

I’ve travelled from the UK to South Africa solo for my friend’s wedding. I won’t see anyone familiar except for the day of the wedding. 

Been here since Thursday, and am here for three weeks. The last 24 hours have been draining, there was an alarm at my hotel which was like a fire alarm, but the automated voice said there had been an “incident” and to await further instructions. I panicked so much, locked my door with my car key close by in case I needed to bolt. The alarm went off four times over a few minutes, but then nothing. This morning I asked about it and apparently it was just a fire alarm (just make that the alarm then, no?).

Then, I guess this is a classic solo occurrence, my breakfast got cleared away as I went back to the buffet for something else. I’d left my drinks there as a kind of marker as I didn’t want to leave my phone and hotel key on the table. No big deal, but it annoyed me a bit.

Car Rental: Northern Lights Car Rental offered the cheapest 4x4. We were a bit nervous due to mixed reviews, but it turned out fine. Thought we’d get a Vitara but they gave us an S-Cross. The Suzuki S-Cross had 330,000 km which worried us but ended up reliable enough.

Food: We mostly cooked with groceries but also tried several restaurants and food trucks. Next time I’d skip Costco because Bónus and Krónan were all we really needed for 13 days. Great sandwiches.

Day 1 (hotel in Reykjavik): Went straight from the airport to the Blue Lagoon.

I’m training for an upcoming 8-day alpine backpacking trip and I’d love to hear how others physically prepare for long days under load.

What kinds of workouts or hikes do you do in the weeks/months leading up to a big trip?

Do you train with a weighted pack? How often? Do you simulate back-to-back hike days?

I’ve been doing strength training, day hikes with a gradually heavier pack, and weekend longer hikes—but I’m curious what worked (or didn’t) for others when it came to building endurance, preventing injury, and recovering well on trail.

And I did. Kinda.

If not much to do in Nottingham, is there a nearby town we would have time to take the train to? Would it make sense to train to Oxford (or any other suggestions), then Nottingham, then back to London?

Departed home around 5:30. Amazing sunrise as I entered Santa Ysabel just crossing up and over the egg farms outside of Ramona. Stopped at Inaja memorial picnic area and did a hike around in Inaja Peak, which was thick with Manzanita and oaks, absolutely stunning views of all western lands covered in low clouds. There is no documented trail system around the park on CalTopo, Strava, or even the info kiosk. It was a pleasant meander well worth it.

Prepaid fishing and boat launch fees at the Cuyamaca store. We ended up not launching my Old Town Discovery 158 canoe due to the windy conditions the following day. While this would upset me on any other day. The breeze blowing throughout the entire camp stay kept the bugs down and was some of the best weather I’ve camped in a long time.

Time - Sep/Oct

Interests : Culture and a bit of History, Nature, Beaches, Group hikes, Architecture, Food(not sure if there’s much for me as I am a vegetarian and dont drink 😓)

Restriction : Fly in and out of Barcelona (have some office work)

Right now I’ve planned the days as follows: 

2 days- exploring Barcelona (Major attractions, El Born, Carmel Bunkers etc)

1 day - Montserrat day trip

1 day - Girona/tarragona/tossa de mar (still confused which one to pick)

3 days - seville (flight from Barcelona)  

1 day - was thinking of going for a day trip to Cordoba but not sure how good it will be

2 days - Granada , and fly back to Barcelona

Context: We (family of 4) are headed to Japan for 3 weeks next year (mid-May to June). As both parents have been to Japan and the boys will still be quite young (4.5yo and 1yo), the goal isn't to see everything but to take it slow and do stuff that's age-appropriate for the kids, enjoy the food and nature and to essentially show the kids a different way of life from what they're used to in London.

We plan on doing many more trips to Japan as a family so no pressure to hit everything this trip, and we prefer to avoid lots of packing/unpacking so would like to use certain cities as a base. 

We have flexibility as this is actually a month-long trip, with Hong Kong attached at the end of the Japan leg. Don't need to stick to 21 days in Japan; can be more.

3. Rental car return at Fiumicino is terribly marked - the only bad spot of the trip. Be very watchful - it involves a barely marked left turn into the garage at the end that your GPS system will likely miss.

BANGKOK -- The latest deadly clashes along the Thai-Cambodian border have prompted the Thai armed forces to activate a three-phase strategy to be ready for a full-scale war with its eastern neighbor, multiple military and intelligence sources told Nikkei Asia.

Dubbed the Chakrabongse Phuwanat Plan, it lays out how land, air and naval assets would be deployed if the clashes with the Cambodian military escalate, according to a version of the document seen by Nikkei Asia.

The plan, named after a respected 19th-century prince recognized as the founder of the modern Thai military, is part of Thailand's military doctrine to be weaponized when the country faces foreign threats on its borders.

We always made sure to respect the nature and follow local rules. It’s such a beautiful and fragile place, and we want to help keep it that way.

Truman said that sending troops to Korea was the hardest decision he made. Of course he also made the decision to drop two atomic bombs

As a tourist here in South Korea, it's so impressive to see what the country has become after the total destruction from that war just a few decades ago

The worst part is the healthcare system. I was aware that the U.S. medical system was brutal and merciless, but I didn’t realize just how bad it really is. One of my clients told me that her father passed away because they couldn't afford a proper medical checkup and only discovered the illness too late. It was heartbreaking — in a country where, if you can’t pay, you simply have to die.
That made me reflect more deeply on how grateful I am for the excellent healthcare system we enjoy in Korea, something I used to take for granted.

Is there any place nearby without a free or at least relatively cheap beach? I am willing to drive up to an hour just to chill on a nice, possibly gravel beach. Any help will be greatly appreciated. 🙏

Six months ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1i25hsk/i_have_accepted_that_not_all_dream_destinations/) because I was frustrated with the high prices of flight tickets and the complex logistics of visiting South Africa, which was the only pending one of the 5 dream destinations I had since I was a teenager. Back in March, I canceled my trip to Argentina (it was definitely destiny as Bariloche is having a very bad year with almost no snow) and decided to use the money to visit South Africa because of discounts in hotel (low season - winter) and flight ticket (through a partner airline). It was definitely crazy to visit Cape Town in winter, but as Bon Jovi said ""It's now or never"".

Hi everyone,

Cross posting this here as this sub may be more appropriate.


I’m currently commuting from Bristol to London twice a week and I’m looking for the most economical way to get back and forth. Unfortunately, moving to London isn’t an option right now, so I’m exploring different travel methods:

1. Carpooling / Rideshare

* Has anyone had luck finding reliable co-passengers or drivers?
* Which platforms or community groups (e.g. Facebook groups, Slack, travel forums) work best for arranging consistent rideshares?

*2. Coach + Foldable Bike

* I’m thinking about taking a coach (like National Express) to London and bringing a foldable bike for city travel.
* Does anyone have experience doing this?

  * Are there any issues or restrictions carrying a foldable bike on board?
  * Is there adequate storage space—or do you recommend other coach services that are more bike-friendly?

**3. Other options?

* Maybe even rail season tickets, split travelcards, or cheaper train+cycling c",London 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿,,False,False,False,self.uktravel,1m4yyt3,[],european_travel,1.0,5.0,64.0,2.4,153.99320028944445,0.7255544431188162,52.83548435960424

I’ve been planning a trip to Jeju and was really looking forward to exploring the island freely by car. I even booked one through Booking.com with Yesaway, but I’ve since realized that basically every rental company requires you to be at least 21—some even 22 or older.

The kicker? I’m 20 and I turn 21 literally two months after my trip. I have a valid license, international driving permit, and I drive responsibly, but none of that seems to matter. It’s so frustrating because I didn’t expect it to be this strict, and now it’s starting to look like renting a car might not be possible at all.

Has anyone had experience renting a car in Jeju under 21? Or found a smaller/local company that’s more flexible with age restrictions? Or even any workarounds that don’t involve totally giving up on driving?

If car rental truly isn’t an option, I’d also love tips on how realistic it is to see Jeju without one—like with buses or taxis.

I’m flying from Antalya to Germany soon with hand luggage only and just realized I can’t bring the 3 sealed bottles of olive oil (180ml, 200ml, 250ml) I bought as gifts for family because of the liquid restrictions.

The airline wants 40€ to add a 15kg checked bag and that’s just way too much for carrying a few bottles of oil.

Any creative ideas or experiences?

Anyone ever asked another traveler with checked baggage for help?

Is there a cheap shipping method from Turkey and/or do you have experience with any? I looked into some stuff but what I've seen was quite complicated and not really a cheap alternative.

I think there is no better solution, both are very nice and it only depends on mindset and situation.

In my case, I decided to walk through Europe, from Belgium to Romania. I wanted to be as immersed in nature as possible. Therefore I chose the hammock.

The pro's of my setup were the extreme closeness to nature the whole trip.

The con's were some situations where I could not hang my hammock and slept on the ground. In those situations I didn't have much protection from the wind and the cold. My solution for that was a Gore-Tex bivy bag.

So my wife and I are going to be at Lake Como for 3 nights in the second week of November, and we're just trying to figure out how to get around. We'd love to stay in Bellagio, and we're thinking of taking a train from Milan to Como, then a ferry to Bellagio, but I can't seem to find any information about when the ferries travel in November, and what times we'd actually be able to go? We were thinking of leaving Milan in the evening, but may have to change our plans depending when the ferries to Bellagio actually go? 

As far as I can tell, the official ticketing for the ferries on the lake are from https://www.navigazionelaghi.it/en/tickets-and-timetables-lake-como/, but their timetable (as far as I can tell) is only until October 5th. If the ferry connections around that time aren't great, we may end up just staying in Como and then doing a day trip to Bellagio, but we're hoping to find out about the ferry timetable soon so we can at least book our accommodation.

We’re looking for somewhere beautiful, on the water, can get around without a car, and a bonus is if it’s somewhere a little less packed (since I know we’re going to Italy at the busiest time). The top choice I’ve found so far is Elba Island. Is this a good place to spend an entire week? Other options we’ve looked at are Lake Como, Lake Garda, and Portofino.

I have seen quite a few posts on this issue, but haven’t seen any follow-up regarding the outcome, especially recently. 

From my understanding, second generation or multiple nationality-holding Koreans are not required to serve in the military as long as they do not intend to stay permanently (> 180 days) or be employed.

* **Bangkok** (Sep 13–19) – First time in Thailand, just exploring and adjusting
* **Kuala Lumpur** (Sep 19–26) – Quick stop to check out the city and maybe a bit of coworking
* **Da Nang / Hoi An, Vietnam** (Sep 26–Oct 4) – Heard great things, looking for chill vibes and good food
* **Bali** (full month of October) – This part is flexible. → *Where should I stay?* I’m looking for:
   * Strong & stable Wi-Fi (will be working a bit)
   * Access to fitness (gym / sports / maybe football/soccer)
   * Nice beach atmosphere

* Works well **for international and Chinese audiences**

Our rough plan is to drive up to Baie St Paul and then continue up to Taddousac, Saugenay Fjord, and drive back via Laurentides (175) or La Maurice (155) and return the car in Montreal. With Montreal and Ottawa already on the itinerary we would probably skip Quebec City.

🇹🇭 Update on Thai-Cambodian border conflict — Child killed, hospitals targeted, humanitarian crisis escalating

We now have confirmation that the youngest victim of the Cambodian attack is a 8-year-old Thai boy, killed by ongoing shelling from Cambodian forces.

As of today, more civilians have died or been critically injured, and border hospitals are running dangerously low on blood supplies.

However, the situation has worsened even further:
Cambodian forces fired explosives at a hospital that was actively treating emergency patients. This forced a full-scale evacuation, severely disrupting medical operations and causing a rise in the death toll.

Deliberately targeting civilians and medical infrastructure is a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions and Customary International Humanitarian Law.

All of this is super flexible since I will be solo and will only book each stay/activity a few days in advance.

- Tokyo -> Toyama -> Kanazawa -> Osaka -> Nara -> Tokyo
- My second time in Japan, but my first solo trip. Previously I did the classic Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka loop in a group.
- This was a fairly fast paced trip, sometimes with two cities scheduled in a day
- In general, I browse things pretty quickly. As in I might look at something, maybe take a picture, then move on

## Dates:
### Oct 27 (Tokyo) - ARRIVAL
- [Asakusa](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3004.html)

Since I arrived in the afternoon, I visited Asakusa since I was staying nearby. It's undeniably pretty but crowded, and honestly, I don't think temples are Tokyo's strong point. Still, worth a quick stop if you're in the area. After a bit of wandering, I called it a night.

### Oct 28 (Toyama + Kanazawa)
- [Toyama Glass Art Museum](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7503.html)
- [Toyama City Hall Observation Tower](https://www.toyamashi-kankoukyoukai.jp/en/?tid=201171)

My wife and I will be heading to Kumamoto/Miyazaki for obon. My wife has a few family commitments, but we'll also have some sightseeing time. We've already decided that we'd like to do Takachiho Gorge - now we're wondering if it's possible to fit in a visit to Mt. Aso during our trip. To be honest, by visiting Mt. Aso, we're still a bit undecided about whether we simply want to visit a lookout like Daikanbo, or go up to the visitor center. I'm aware it's currently under a level 2 advisory, so going near the crater is out of the question.

We think we have two options. We have a car.

1 - There are a couple of days in Kumamoto where we are free in the morning, but need to be back in Kumamoto by 2pm. Not sure if this is enough time to go to Aso and back. 

2 - For Takachiho, the current plan is to start the day in Miyazaki city, drive to Takachiho, and then return to Kumamoto. We're wondering if it's possible to also stop at Mt. Aso after Takachiho.

I don't want to avoid the big cities for obvious reasons, I want to explore and meet new people. But as freeing as having a car will be, in this regard it feels quite limiting - as I'm always going to be concerned about the safety of my car!

The advice online suggests that you should make sure that there are no valuables in your car at all, but that's just not possible for me. Of course I will carry with me whatever I can in my day bag but I am also bringing a surfboard, a tent, and other large expensive items that might attract attention.

Hey everyone,

I’ve been living and working in Asia (Korea) for years, mostly teaching English online. I’ve spent time in Laos, Cambodia, Korea, and elsewhere — What’s been burning in my mind lately is this:

👉 I want to start a small, low-cost or free school in a rural area like Don Det, or in the islands in Cambodia. 

Not some shiny, elite international school — I mean a community-based space where anyone (kids, teens, even adults) can come learn English and life skills. My dream is to make it sustainable through a mix of online teaching income (I’ll continue working remotely), tourist-driven microprojects (like student-made postcards or cooking classes), and maybe some outside support. I want the locals to eventually help shape and run it.

I’m not rich, I’m not trying to “save” anyone, and I don’t want to bulldoze in with a Western ego. I just want to offer something useful and meaningful, with humility and care.

So I’m reaching out to anyone who:

I [21M] recently had the desire to solo travel between graduating college and working full-time. I decided on Europe and planned it pretty last-minute, booking a lot of it on the go. 

I’d been lurking on this sub leading up to and during my trip, and I wanted to make a trip report of my own. I’m writing this on my flight back home!

**Budget:**

I was fortunate to have financial support as a graduation gift which enabled me to travel. Even so, I operated frugally in most cases. Flights were covered almost entirely by air miles; I exclusively stayed in hostels; I travelled by train/bus between cities (SBB, Trenitalia, ÖBB, Flixbus); many activities and excursions were free or inexpensive (churches, monuments, UNESCO sites, hikes).

I treated myself to 1-2 “splurge meals” per city, and ate from grocery stores and cheaper restaurants for the rest. For pricier activities, I went on 1 guided coach tour, saw 2 concerts, and visited a few museums.

Total spend was ~$3,500 (e",Trip Report,,False,False,False,self.solotravel,1m7mhbf,[],adventure_travel,1.0,5.0,13.0,0.1111111111111111,80.398755845,0.8457788095358671,10.995124523966274

I had some success renting a long term storage for a SEA trip. I rented a monthly storage in Hong Kong and used HK as a hub. I reconfigure my packing depending on the trip. Scuba for Philippines, photo for Cambodia, one bag for urban destinations etc.

The degree of difficulties to rent monthly locker in HK is high. They require HKID, local address and  bank account. Luckily I have the ID, can use relative's address.

-2 nights in a hotel in Edinburgh
- Pick up the campervan and do 4 nights in highlands and Isle of Skye staying at a different campsite each night
-2 nights at Cameron House in Loch Lomond 
-Final night in Edinburgh before flying out

This is our first time traveling in a camper van. We’re curious if anyone has any recommendations for how we should prepare. 

We added bedding to our rental. Will that be enough or will we freeze?

We don’t have a toilet in the van, are planning to o stay only in campsites, and don’t want to get stuck in any tight situations. Anything we might not be thinking of?

What about refilling water bottles? Is that easy to do?

I would love a direct service from A to B, so that if the first lag of the journey is slow I don’t miss the second half, but it looks like that isn’t an option. Would it be a better idea to take an alternative route? The only thing I can really find is Can Tho - HCMC - PP - Kampot.

I’m planning a solo weekend trip to Tatacoa Desert and wanted to sanity-check my itinerary and ask a couple quick questions.

* Head straight to Villavieja for the night. I'm leaning towards staying in Villavieja.

1. Does this plan seem realistic time-wise? Anything I’m missing?
2. I really want to catch at least one sunrise and one sunset in the desert. Is it easy (or even possible) to get transport from Villavieja early in the morning (before sunrise), and then again after sunset — either back to the town or to the observatory?
