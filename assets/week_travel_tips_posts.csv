In that time, I visited the legendary Deadvlei & Sossusvlei (pic 3 - 8), walked with cheetahs, found some incredible dining spots (food in Namibia is seriously good), and went on two safaris.

I do think it’s one of the most amazing places I’ve seen so far (currently been to 45 countries). 

Granted, I was very lucky to see Namibia green, as it rained every single day while I was there. On a couple of days, there were even some proper thunderstorms (last pic).

Happy to answer questions if you’re planning your trip!

And if you’ve already been to Namibia, what are the other “must-dos” if I get a chance to come back?

I get a maximum of one week, so overseas destinations that require jet lag acclimation aren't a viable option for me (or so I think, feel free to convince me otherwise!)

My friend and I visited the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul today (July 26, 2025) around 7:30 PM. We lined up at the official entrance and bought our tickets directly from the ticket office at the gate — no third-party vendors, no guides.

To our surprise, we were each charged ₺2,400 (Turkish Lira) — so ₺4,800 total ($120 USD) for two people. We weren’t offered any extras like a guided tour, audio headset, or combo pass (at least not that we were aware of). It was just standard admission, and the visit lasted about 20 minutes.

This price seems way above what I’ve seen online (₺600–₺800 max per person?), so I’m wondering:
- Has the entry fee recently increased?
- Did we accidentally purchase something else (VIP access, combo ticket, etc.)?
- Has anyone else been charged this amount recently?

Hey everyone. My mom is a new traveler and she booked a flight with a layover which lands in gatwick then leaves from Heathrow within 3 hours. She will have to go through customs, get her checked bag, transport to Heathrow, and re check back in / go through security. I’m not sure that’s possible in the allotted time. Any suggestions to make this as speedy as possible? The airline told her that if she misses her connection the rest of her itinerary will be cancelled as per protocol.

The bag went with was the **Tortuga Expandable Backpack**. I found it to be just as comfortable as the Aer TP3 but with more storage, less organization, and still passed as a personal item on AA. For reference I'm 5'7 180lbs. Compressing the bag makes the center of gravity closer to your back which greatly enhanced the comfort for me.

Right now, I’m thinking of visiting the following cities:

 In the south: London, Cambridge, Oxford

 In the middle: Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield

 In the north: Edinburgh and the Highlands


I hope to plan the route smoothly without too much backtracking.

For accommodation, I'm looking for mid-range options, nothing fancy, but not too rough either. I’m not too picky about food, just want decent meals without spending too much.

I’ve heard transport in the UK can be quite expensive, so I’m especially looking for money-saving tips on getting around!

We got in the house and it reeked of mold and I saw mold spots on the walls. There was an orange dust coating all the hardwoods, but the worst problem was the bed linens were covered in what looked like psoriasis debris (my family suffers so I know what it looks like--big flakes of skin). There were also cobwebs, spiders, random uncooked noodles on the floors, etc. She charges a hefty cleaning so I was pretty shocked.

The host consulted with Airbnb and immediately agreed to let us leave and refund our money. Airbnb gave us a nice gift card for the trouble after seeing the photos.

I’ve travelled from the UK to South Africa solo for my friend’s wedding. I won’t see anyone familiar except for the day of the wedding. 

Been here since Thursday, and am here for three weeks. The last 24 hours have been draining, there was an alarm at my hotel which was like a fire alarm, but the automated voice said there had been an “incident” and to await further instructions. I panicked so much, locked my door with my car key close by in case I needed to bolt. The alarm went off four times over a few minutes, but then nothing.

I rented a car from Avis in Vancouver with the plan to return it there. Midway through the trip, I had a flare-up of an old knee injury — shooting pain that made it genuinely unsafe for me to continue the long drive. I called Avis customer service to ask if I could return the car in Seattle instead. The rep said yes, that’s okay — but never mentioned any fees or penalties.

Now I’ve been charged $1000, and when I called back to ask why, they just said it was “system generated” and refused to give any breakdown. The only thing the rep vaguely said was that they would “have to send someone to get the car from Seattle.” But if that’s true, why does the charge scale with how many days I booked the car for?

And I did. Kinda.

It wasn’t a clean trip. I ended up on the wrong side of the valley the first day and had to make camp in the rain at almost 12,000 feet (3,660 m).

Recently I ordered a soft toy from Amazon, its huge in actual size, like 3ft or something but Amazon had vacuum packed it to the size of a laptop. Since then I started wondering if I could use that.

So I was starting to consider if vacuum packing would be a good idea. In my mind if I can use that I can even compress my pillows and take them with me and then leave them in the sun for a couple days to let them stretch out.

Do the magic bags and vacuum bags sold on Amazon and Walmart do job effectively enough if anyone has experience with them.

He kept trying to hold my hand, and I had to ask him to stop multiple times. As a solo female traveler, this was completely unacceptable and made me feel unsafe.

After leaving an honest review about the situation on TripAdvisor, I began receiving messages that I interpreted as intimidation—urging me to remove the review.

* I plan to travel overland where it makes sense, especially overnight buses/trains. But also plan to splurge on a flight when it saves a lot of time and hassle (ex. will probably fly from Laos to Hanoi instead of dealing with a 24 hr bus)
* I do want to leave wiggle room for unexpected side quests and delays, but I also appreciate having a plan and general idea of things before

I'm heading to Peru for 4 weeks this November and trying to find the right single pair of shoes that can handle everything — from hiking to walking around cities and even the odd night out.

My trip includes:

The Salkantay Trek (with a guided group)
Colca Canyon
Rainbow Mountain
Urban wandering in Cusco, Lima, Arequipa
Activities in Huacachina
General backpacking travel across the country
I’ll be packing light with a 40L bag, so ideally just one pair of shoes + a rubber sandal (for showers, beach, chill days). No boots — I’m trying to balance trail performance, comfort, and street wearability.

What I’m looking for:

No GTX — I’ve read that non-waterproof shoes drain/dry better in wet season and help avoid trench foot
Something with grip, but still light and comfortable for big walking days in cities
Bonus if it looks decent — not a big fan of super techy shoes that scream “I’m hiking”

Shoes I’ve considered:

Salomon XA Pro 3D v9 (non-GTX) – likely my top pick so far

I haven’t made it a “formal” thing with my employer yet, mainly because I’m unsure if it would be an issue. Technically, I’m still working UK hours, and nothing changes in terms of performance or availability. But I do wonder:
	•	Have you told your employer if you’re working remotely from a different country?
	•	Did you need to get permission first?
	•	How did they react?
	•	Were there any tax/legal complications?

While Marrakech itself is fascinating, some of Morocco’s most stunning places are just a day away. Here are my top 5 recommendations for day trips from Marrakech, based on experience (not just Instagram):


1. Ouzoud Waterfalls
Distance: ~2.5 hours
These are the tallest waterfalls in North Africa. You’ll find monkeys, misty viewpoints, and even boat rides under the falls. It's a great escape from the heat.

2. Imlil & the High Atlas Mountains
 Distance: ~1.5 hours
Ideal for hiking lovers. You’ll get breathtaking views of Mount Toubkal, meet local Amazigh (Berber) villagers, and eat traditional tagine in their homes.

When I traveled through Europe last year, I had a hard time finding plugs close to the bed.  Other CPAP users on the tour ended up buying extension cords but they took up a lot of room.  Recently, I found this USB-C / CPAP adapter, and it works great. with the proper battery bank.  I took a chance with the smaller battery and I am only using about 25% of the battery at night and am confident that I could get at least 2 nights on a single charge (maybe 3).  There is one trick though that I haven't figured out, if I leave the Air mini plugged in while I am not using it for some reason the battery will drain in a couple of hours, no idea why.  That said if I plug it in right before bed and then unplug it as soon as I get up in the morning \~ 7 hrs sleep, then it consistently uses about 25%.

This is the adapter that I got (they shipped to Canada and only took a few days)

I treated myself to 1-2 “splurge meals” per city, and ate from grocery stores and cheaper restaurants for the rest. For pricier activities, I went on 1 guided coach tour, saw 2 concerts, and visited a few museums.
