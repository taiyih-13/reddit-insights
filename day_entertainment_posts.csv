I was just a baby but I was in my baby bed or inside house when the outdoor scenes were filmed.  When the inside scenes were filmed, we stayed somewhere else.

Tobe Hooper wanted to use the house in his movie but hippy parents had been dodging the Vietnam draft and were growing a huge plot or weed to sell to the people around Austin.  A patch had just been planted and the first 5 inches had already sprouted.  

Tobe Hooper paid for the whole patch as if it was fully grown and ready to sale to have it all removed.

He couldn't have mature marijuana plants in the outside scenes.  It was the early 70s.  No one would have put his movie in their theaters with bud growing in the fields.

I also rewatched the Ocean’s trilogy this week and the new original Ocean’s Eleven is almost 25 years old. But when you watch it it doesn’t seem like a product of its time. It could have been made a month ago and probably would look mostly the same. 

Then I started thinking further back and movies like Speed and the Fugitive don’t feel like 30 year old movies.

Sadly, it seems like they only went nuts on the visuals because the structure, characterisation (if you want to call it that), and third act stuff is all typical 'Marvel' stuff we've seen for the past several years.

As I noted in my own review: ""top quality actors and visual spectacle can only elevate subpar screenwriting by so much, and First Steps can’t overcome the usual Marvel shortcomings of a thinly-drawn villain, little to no actual stakes, and a third act filled with CGI mess.""

Not a bad movie per se, just a very.... serviceable one, but perhaps not the slam dunk or shot in the arm Marvel needs before banking it all on Avengers: Doomsday.

I'd give it about a 6 maybe 6.5/10. It had an interesting spin on the ""Groundhog Day"" style, but they definitely missed a chance to have each night be totally different. Could've had 3-4 mini horror movies in one. I like the idea that the night uses fears of the one trapped there to determine what they experience and I think that idea lends to a franchise. I wish they would have explored the ""how"" and ""why"" a little more with the Doc's character. Their biggest problem was calling it ""Until Dawn"". ~~I get that it has more name recognition than ""Dark Pictures Anthology"", but~~ giving it that name set expectations among fans of the game and when the ""Groundhog Day"" style premise was announced, it had lost a big following right away.

I've read through them all and an fascinated by the range of responses to the film, from loving the first 20 mins and hating the rest of the film to viewing it as one of the best cosmic horror films of the last decade or longer.

I think *The Amazing Spider-Man* series is more faithful to the comic books than the Sam Raimi *Spider-Man* series, but I think the Sam Raimi *Spider-Man* series are better movies overall.

By these standards, it feels less probable than, say, five Rossellini films in the Top 30.

Again, I'm not here to put his work into question, I can't stress that enough. His films are awesome, but I'm curious whether there's some story behind the extraordinary reception they enjoy on Letterboxd. Was there maybe a feature article early on about his films?

He’s a comedic genius and so under appreciated. He speaks to our humanity so well and captures the mundane, little moments perfectly. I love this show with all my heart, and all his other shows are hilarious too, his character work is unmatched.

Austin Powers in Goldmember may not be the best of the trilogy for many but it’s the one I rewatched the most growing up and the one that has so many hilarious moments that stick in my mind.

Another that stands out is a Simon Pegg/Nick Frost vehicle where Seth Rogen plays an alien. I don't remember anything about the movie except that either Pegg or Frost's character has drawn a comic where on the front page there's a female alien with three breasts, which I believe is repeatedly referenced and the pair is defensive about it. The payoff is that at one point Pegg and Frost are talking to police who are amused by the comic cover, then one of them says ""You should have given her four boobs."" And Pegg responds ""That's just sick!""
