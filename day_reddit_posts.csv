Normally when Bitcoin hits new highs, my phone goes crazy.. friends texting, asking if they should buy, or telling me, ""Hey, you were right!"" But now? Nothing. Complete silence.

Honestly, I wasn't even surprised.

It seems like the excitement around Bitcoin has changed. ETFs have quietly built up huge holdings. Big companies have started keeping Bitcoin in their reserves without making noise about it. Even hotel chains and smaller businesses have joined in, silently buying in the background. But regular people mostly stood by, unsure if even $60K was already too expensive.

It feels like big institutions finally figured it out. They didn't talk loudly or create hype.. they just quietly bought Bitcoin. Most regular investors didn’t even notice.

It gave up all of its July gains, just like that. Back to July 8 levels. On the 4H, it tapped the 100 SMA and stalled hard. At first, I thought it was just a typical retrace… until I saw this:

👉 The SEC rejected Bitwise’s “10 ex-BTC/ETH” altcoin ETF and XRP was reportedly the main reason for the rejection.

That kind of killed the altcoin ETF momentum before it even started. And if that rejection holds weight, it could send a broader signal to institutions: stick with BTC, for now.

It made me think , what happens when ETF-driven liquidity is denied access to alts like XRP?

Well, it has to go somewhere. And the safest, most ""institutionally correct"" place? Bitcoin.

TIA for any assistance or advice...

So, I've been throwing $20/month into BTC for some time now, and am seeing what everyone here knows.  It's a great investment.  

My question is, how can I really make my investment strategy better moving forward, and if you all had any tips or advice that might help me continue to realize these profits, and, although I don't think I'll ever be a BTC millionaire necessarily, (certainly not at this rate) However, I'm getting older, and would like to have a decent nest egg in the next 10 years if possible.🤞🏻

Being on a fixed income, I don't have much in the way of income to invest, however, I've been considering trying a few things that might give me the ability to ramp up my investment. 

One think I'm considering, is changing my strategy, and instead of distributing my monthly investments into stocks and other crypto, to take all of my earmarked ""savings"" income just to BTC.

The U.S. spends trillions more than it collects in taxes.  
  
To fund the deficit, it sells debt in the form of Treasury bills (USTs).

Stablecoins fill it. By design.

Stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether run one of the simplest, most profitable models in finance:  
  
1. Taking in dollar deposits   
2. Issuing dollar stablecoins on top   
3. Using the deposits to buy t-bills and collect the yield  
  
With t-bills yielding \~5%, it's a simple, ultra-profitable model.

But not the $10,000 turned into $10 because there was no liquidity, no exit and no plan.

Musk’s EV maker reported a 16% decline in automotive revenue from a year earlier to $16.7 billion. Total revenue fell 12% to $22.5 billion from $25.5 billion a year earlier, missing the average analyst estimate of $22.74 billion, according to LSEG.

Tesla has been facing rising competition in key markets like China and Europe, especially from lower cost Chinese EV players. In early July, Tesla reported a 14% year-over-year slide in vehicle deliveries to 384,000 for the second quarter. 

And in Europe, Tesla’s new car registrations declined last month, according to data released Thursday from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there’s the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla’s still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

	- Is this just a pyramid scheme?
	- It’s so volatile, how does it even work?
	- Does it even have any real world use?
	- Isn’t it for criminals?

Etc..

But after a few weeks of doubt and resistance, I started asking the deeper questions, the kind most people here have probably wondered at some point.

	- What actually is money?
	 - How does the current global financial       system really work?
	- Why does it feel like my money buys less every year?
	- How do I protect what I earn from inflation?

Eventually, the penny dropped, and I got to the bottom of the well: I could no longer ignore that the purchasing power of the dollar was eroding fast. Saving in dollars is like trying to fill a leaky bucket. The only logical response is to invest in assets.

Here’s how the chipmaker did versus LSEG consensus estimates:

* **Revenue**: $12.6 billion versus $11.92 billion estimated

Intel said it expects revenue for the third-quarter of $13.1 billion at the midpoint of its range, versus the average analyst estimate of $12.65 billion. The chipmaker said that it expects to break even on earnings while analysts were looking for earnings of 4 cents per share.

For the second quarter, Intel reported a net loss of $2.9 billion, or 67 cents per share, compared with a $1.61 billion net loss, or 38 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.

So while theoretically the chance to guess the key to sign an existing UTXO is infintesmally small, because you'd have only 1 right answer, isn't the chance to guess the key to a signing device (wallet) MUCH higher because there are millions of wallets?

So as Bitcoin adoption grows, doesn't the chance of guessing wallet keys become more viable?

TBL analyzed the July 22 tariff rates assuming they stay in effect in perpetuity.

Current Tariff Rate: Consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate of 20.2%, the highest since 1911. After consumption shifts, the average tariff rate will be 19.3%, the highest since 1933.

Overall Price Level & Distributional Effects: The price level from all 2025 tariffs rises by 2.0% in the short-run, the equivalent of an average per household income loss of $2,700 in 2025$. This assumes the Federal Reserve does not react to tariffs and so the real income adjustment comes primarily through prices rather than nominal incomes; if the Federal Reserve reacted, the adjustment could in part come in the form of lower nominal incomes.

 In such a monetary environment, hyper-speculative excesses are quickly exposed and forced to confront the market's real-time preferences. The market is guided by a real rate of return aligned with real interest rate. Consequently, even speculative growth stocks are expected to eventually turn a profit or be forced out of the capital market. Capital is indeed scarce, and conservatism is the name of the game. 

This is not at all the environment we see today. 

Sound economic calculation is almost impossible since  every single aspect of the pricing ecosystem is speculative and untrustworthy. It is all a giant casino of uncertainty that benefits Wall Street’s tendency towards securitization.

 That’s why Gold and Bitcoin are performing so well against a backdrop of overinflated equities.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt.
