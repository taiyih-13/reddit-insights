Both the technical and fundamental set-up (34.5% short interest) makes this one of the best opportunities I have seen in a very long while. A price target of 10-15$ is very achievable.**

Two months ago I posted a 408K YOLO into IOVA with ten points of DD (I highly recommend you read this if you haven't already as I outline the basics of the company + main theses there): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k\_yolo\_into\_iova/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k_yolo_into_iova/)

Since then, the stock has risen over 80% on multiple positive updates and my position grew to 800K (after I also added \~12k shares). I believe that a few recent developments, however, are so substantial that they warrant a new post, and my conviction in the stock has never been higher.

The comments were full of sympathy but not a lot of help, so I DMed him and said, “I can’t do much, but I can send you a little something if it helps you get back on your feet.”

He was shocked. I sent the BTC. I didn’t think twice about it.

We kept in touch for a while. He used the money to get temporary lodging and a new laptop. Eventually, he found work again.

When future fusion reactors print gold as a by-product of energy the gold supply will increase. The Bitcoin supply won't even if they try to use that energy to mine it. 

The most creative part of Satoshi's invention was arguably the addition of the difficulty adjustment to ensure that the Bitcoin supply schedule would stay on track even in the face of changing mining hashrate due to high Bitcoin demand or an abundance of energy. It's a mechanism that sets Bitcoin apart from most other supply/demand systems. 

Obviously the production of gold from fusion at scale is nowhere near reality (and the produced gold will be radioactive for 14 years), but it's an interesting thought experiment nonetheless.

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US President’s threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times.

Both sides would waive tariffs on some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said.

The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts.

The bloc’s exporters have been paying an additional 10 per cent tariff on goods sent to the US since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent.

This is the important lesson on Tesla. It was a great story many years ago. People thought Elon was all that mattered.

The stock is at the same price it was in 2021. It has gone nowhere for four years.

I made a statement in our 24/7 community right after the earnings release. I said we are going to wake up 10 to 20 years from now and Tesla will still be below its current all-time high. Or if it happens to make a new all-time high in the near future, it will not surpass the one it hit at the end of the last bull market.

It is not a software company. It is not a tech company. It is a car company. 90% of its revenue comes from cars. Go to the Tesla website. That is what it is.

Here's a step by step. im not saying you should do this but given my experience in this field, this is how i would start.

step 1 : i would paper trade for atleast 3-4 months t get the feel of the market before putting live money to work.

with a $5k account, you don’t have the luxury of swinging for the fences. you’re not here to double your money in a month.

you’re here to:

* stay alive
* learn discipline
* stack small, repeatable wins

so forget the YOLO weeklies. forget earnings plays. forget SPX 0DTE scalps.

* Revenue: $3.06 billion vs. $3.11 billion expected

While the company still remains a leader in the EV space, the market seems to be questioning its next moves.

The big headline? Tesla is still pushing ahead with its plans for a ""more affordable"" model, set to start production in late 2025. While no exact details were revealed, this could be a game-changer if Tesla can hit that $30,000 price point. Investors are curious to see how this new vehicle will stack up against competitors in an increasingly crowded EV market.

And then there’s the robotaxi. Testing is ramping up in Austin, and Tesla’s still aiming to roll out a driverless ride-hailing service by 2026. This futuristic vision keeps fans excited, but the reality of these vehicles actually hitting the road is still a few years away.

I've been ignoring it and only making minimum payments for too long. Recently, I came into an $18k inheritance and plan to set aside $10k for a house fund, as I intend to buy in the near future. The remaining $8k will go toward paying off my credit cards and establishing a small emergency fund.

I understand that paying off the entire debt and closing the cards could hurt my credit score. If I open a new card for recurring bills and recurring payments like subscriptions, would that help offset the hit? Or would it be more beneficial to pay the cards off gradually, in medium increments like $500 a month, focusing on one card at a time until they’re all paid off?

\--EDIT--

So my general incentive here is to 0 out debt and save the 170ish dollars in minimum payments towards savings. the goal is not to raise the credit score but hurt it as little as possible.

TLDR: Stock go up 

Applied Digital owns and leases data centers for hyper scaler clients. In plain english… AI. While there is a buttload of competition in this space, there is an even larger buttload of money.

OpenAI recently agreed to pay $30B per year to Oracle for data centers leasing. APLD also recently signed a $7B lease contract with CoreWeave with the option to expand the lease by more than double the current MW as APLD builds out additional data center capabilities. Keep in mind that as AI adoption grows, data centers prices rise. OpenAI and Google are both prime examples of these price increases, as both organizations have and plan to continue to jack up prices as demand increases. Higher prices = higher revenues for APLD.

Applied Digital also has $5 billion in funding secured from Macquarie with $900M being used for current buildout and $4.1B for expansion. Perfectly situated to capitalize on the opportunity in hand.

GOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.

But there’s a recurring pattern that’s really starting to wear me down:  
Things go well for a while — I’m focused, disciplined, reading price well, trading in flow. Then something triggers me emotionally. One loss leads to frustration… and I spiral into revenge trading, over-leveraging, and blowing the account. It’s like I know better — but in that moment, I completely lose control.

I have an abusive person from my life who I have cut off completely. But because they are still in contact with a family member, they periodically send me gifts and sometimes money. Usually when I get a gift or check, I will just rip it up and throw it out.

But last year they sent me a cashier's check for a reasonable sum. Some family members told me that they won't know if I cash it or not, so I might as well take the money. I went to the bank that issued the check, and asked the teller before cashing it whether the person who issued the check will know if I cash it? She seemed like she didn't fully understand my question and just said, ""Oh yeah, sure!""

I ripped the check up and left. But to be honest, she sounded like she was just saying whatever she thought I wanted to hear. So I don't trust what she said.

I have just found out from my family member that the abusive person has sent me another cashier's check for an amount of money that wo",Other,1m7djev,0.8,4.0,313.0,1.619047619047619,8.481175651666668,0.9824860675588241,338.81813914591197,Questions & Help,medium
