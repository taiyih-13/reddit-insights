When COVID hit,  solution was massive money printing again.  
And it worked. Markets bounced back, the system didn’t collapse.

Now it feels like every crisis just leads to the same response: **Printing more money.**  
it’s become a habit. A learned behavior.

And honestly, the U.S. doesn’t even *pretend* to care about paying down its national debt anymore.  
They just keep rolling it over,, kick the can down the road.

Even this whole push for stablecoins feels like another version of **passing the burden forward** like a digital shell game to absorb more U.S. debt while buying time.

But at the end of the day, who pays for all this?

**Ordinary people who save money.**

  
People who saves consistently through diligently and honestly everyday are getting crushed.  
Just sitting still means your money loses value every year.

Tomorrow **WILL** be a red day. The perfect storm of:

\-Overextended rally with no drawdowns

\-Bad earnings (INTC, TSLA, DOW) are actually getting shit on, while good earnings results (GOOG, NOW) are only resulting in moderate rises

\-Every recent candle has long tails from drawdown before ending slightly up

\-Friday, perfect time for profit taking (Within this recent rally, 4 out of the 5 last Fridays have posted losses)

\-Trump making boneheaded visit to pressure my king J. Pow into submission

\-I've already bought these puts and can't reverse them before they half in value tomorrow morning

However, I am not **THAT** regarded. I've placed my puts firmly ITM to avoid theta burn if more bullshit chop happens. Got a pretty good time too, even a flat move will turn a mild profit. Godspeed to me and to you, fellow regards.

One of the first things I did was get a new cell phone number in the city I was planning to settle down in.

Almost immediately, I started getting calls and texts from debt collectors, always for a woman I had never heard of. I don’t remember the name now, but the calls were relentless. At first it was polite messages asking her to call back. I would tell them, “I just got this number. I don’t know who that is.” But the calls didn’t stop. They intensified. Over the next few years, I started getting messages saying it was my “final opportunity to settle before a lawsuit.”

Then, in 2019, five years into this, I get a call from a very professional-sounding young woman who says she’s a paralegal calling on behalf of a law firm to collect on a recent legal judgment. I asked for her full name and the law firm, repeated it back, and wrote it all down. Then I calmly said:

Realized market cap needs to be \~2T for btc to be valued @ $1MM.

The current global M2 is \~100T, and is projected to double over the 10 years. You're telling me we're going to get another $100T of fiat in the world, and you don't think *at least* another 1T is going into btc?

Given the ETF, given the BTC treasury companies, given that it is now a Wallstreet asset, it is 100% obvious we're going to get at least another trillion USD into bitcoin over the next 10 years.

If I am wrong, the funding will likely go to either USAR, Rameco, or Lynas. We may see more than one beneficiary. But USAR is quite behind. Rameco is lobbying and trying to play catch up, recently opening up a heavy rare earth mine w/ their coal spin. Lynas has ties to Trump via Gina Rinehart. But they are primarily Australian.

The market is acting emotionally, and I'm acting rationally. The post-earnings price drop was a textbook case of IV crush combined with a market overreaction. While everyone was freaking out about the intraday swing, the actual long-term story only got stronger.

Market cap of gold seems like a reasonable proxy. Can see btc going higher because of the hard limit, flexibility etc. 

If gold market cap is $23.5 tn that implies $1.1mm for bitcoin today and more in the future as inflation continues. So we have a 9x from here at a minimum?

When questioned about it they admitted that if the offer had been a 100k they wouldn’t feel this way but 15-20k increase in salary just didn’t feel like “enough” even though they didn’t even like their current job.

This reserve stems from assets seized in criminal investigations and forfeiture cases, and is intended to establish US dominance in digital asset governance while leveraging Bitcoin's scarcity principle.

**Key Points:**

* The government's $24 billion position represents just 0.065% of America's $37 trillion national debt.
* The reserve is currently inactive, with no movement in federal wallets for four consecutive months.
* The policy shift coincides with the passage of the GENIUS Act, creating federal stablecoin regulations.
* Critics question the wisdom of hoarding volatile assets, while supporters hail the reserve as a ""visionary hedge in the digital age.""

Consolidated net income of **$28.2 billion.**   
  
**My assumptions**

I tried to estimate Alphabet’s fair value using both a P/E multiple approach and a discounted cash‑flow (DCF) model. 

|Assumption|Low|Mid|High|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Earnings per share (starting point)**|**$5.5**|**$7.4**|**$8.0**|

|**Discount rate**|**14 %**|**12 %**|**10 %**|

My growth assumptions are lower than Alphabet’s recent 14 % revenue growth because I don't think Google can sustain >20 % EPS growth over a decade. I am also very worried about the DOJ forcing  major changes to Google’s search business - and this is beyond the risk that ChatGPT/OpenAI are causing.

He specifically said he hopes Musk and all American companies can achieve “unprecedented prosperity.”

Why is this significant?

TSLA has already risen by approximately 12% in July, breaking through the $180-$190 range and approaching the resistance level near $240.

Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) continues to support electric vehicle tax credits and renewable energy subsidies  and the market had already partially factored in the expectation that “if Trump were elected, subsidies might be terminated.”

However, if Trump now states that he is willing to retain these subsidies at least for Musk that would be a clear positive for TSLA bulls.

Just shy of a 5000 dollar loss. Got off easy.

I thought my thesis was correct after seeing red markets everywhere and a little baby downturn in the morning. Got shafted with green dildos the rest of the day. Fuck you and see you next week.

P.S. Looks like the market is coming down now that RobinHood has autoended my position. How fun.

P.P.S. u/spooky_mudler27 has convinced me to roll this. It's either valhalla or the Wendy's dumpster on Monday.

My research on bitcoin, learning as much as I can about it as I can has giving me a hope of an actual retirement some day. I’m a 35yo carpenter and have no benefits to speak of. I have been DCA for a few months, every two weeks( pay day) $200-300 with the goal of $500 a month. I have realized I NEED to not only continue but also double down…When possible… my wife doesn’t seem to fully understand but still supports thankfully. 

My questions for y’all are:
1)Am I crazy for planning a humble retirement with that kind of timeline (15-20yrs) and dca amount?
2) do you have a planned number of years before you call it? Personally if I’m still making money Il still be staking but just curious 
3)how many of y’all are also blue color work class? I feel like almost NO tradies are orange pilled. Am I that rare?

Sounds fairly legit, at least in terms of visibility

Tesla’s Model 3 and Model X passed 5 out of 6 highway scenarios  while Chinese competitors like BYD, Huawei’s Aito, and Xiaomi struggled. Xiaomi’s hyped SU7 only passed 1 of the 6. While it’s not full self-driving, it says a lot about system maturity and consistency

Elon even posted about it on X, kind of flexing that Tesla pulled this off without any locally trained data, thanks to China’s restrictions on data export. He also took a shot at the U.S. for blocking AI model training on Chinese data  classic Elon 

I don’t think this is some kind of short-term stock catalyst, but it’s a solid win for Tesla's tech narrative, especially in a market where Chinese brands have been making a lot of noise about their own smart driving features

I told myself, it’s Friday. I don’t have good results on fridays usually. I don’t even need to trade today. I’m already up for the week. Just end the week green. 

What did I actually do? You guessed it. Jumped on to check the markets “just in case” it behaved similar to the rest of the week. 

Spoiler alert: it did not. I entered 2 losing trades and 1 slight profit for a total loss of 65$. 

I know it’s a business transaction. Every business has costs. Losing is bound to happen. Losing is actually a good thing because every loss we learn more about our psychology and what doesn’t work.
