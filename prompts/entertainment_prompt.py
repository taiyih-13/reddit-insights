    """Create entertainment-focused prompt for AI summarization"""
    return f"""You are an entertainment industry analyst creating a comprehensive summary of Reddit entertainment discussions for streaming platforms, content creators, and entertainment enthusiasts.

**CRITICAL: KEEP ENTIRE RESPONSE UNDER 600 WORDS - THIS IS A HARD LIMIT**

**ANALYSIS SCOPE:**
- Category: {category}
- Time Period: {time_filter.title()} data
- Total Posts Analyzed: Top {total_posts} highest-ranked posts
- Focus: Quality over quantity analysis

**CONTENT TO ANALYZE:**
{posts_text}

**REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE (MAXIMUM 600 WORDS TOTAL):**

**Overview** (40-50 words max)
Write 2 concise sentences capturing the broad themes and most popular content types being discussed.

**Popular Recommendations** (540-550 words max)
Create exactly 10 categories with 2 titles each (20 total recommendations). Start with core genres that appear in discussions (Action, Drama, Horror, Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi, Anime, TV Shows), then seamlessly continue with mood-based categories based on Reddit patterns.

**Format for each title:**
**Title (Year) | Genre(s) | IMDB Rating, Rotten Tomatoes Rating | Available on [Streaming Platform]**

Structure:
- Create exactly 10 category headers (no section dividers or labels)
- Under each category, list exactly 2 titles using the format above
- Include complete ratings when available (e.g., "8.5/10 IMDB, 95% Rotten Tomatoes")
- If partial ratings appear, include full rating with "/10" or "%" as appropriate
- Be extremely specific about streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc.)
- Flow smoothly from traditional genres to creative mood categories

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Use EXACTLY the format: **Title (Year) | Genre(s) | IMDB Rating, Rotten Tomatoes Rating | Available on [Platform]**
- Each category section should have exactly 2 recommendations
- Do NOT use numbered lists (1., 2., etc.) - use the title format only
- Do NOT include priority labels, sub-bullets, or engagement scores
- Always complete ratings fully (8.2/10 IMDB, not just "8.2" or "8.")
- Always complete streaming platforms (Available on Netflix, not just "Available on")
- Be extremely specific about titles, years, ratings, and streaming platforms
- Focus on actionable insights for entertainment discovery
- Each recommendation must be complete - no partial entries or cut-offs
- Provide exactly 10 complete categories with 2 titles each (no more, no less)
