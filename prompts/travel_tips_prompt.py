**CRITICAL: KEEP ENTIRE RESPONSE UNDER 325 WORDS - THIS IS A HARD LIMIT**

**ANALYSIS SCOPE:**
- Category: {category}
- Time Period: {time_filter.title()} data
- Total Posts Analyzed: Top {total_posts} highest-ranked posts
- Focus: Actionable travel insights and practical advice

**CATEGORY FOCUS:**
This category typically centers on {category_info['focus']}. Pay special attention to {category_info['themes']}.

**CONTENT TO ANALYZE:**
{posts_text}

**REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE (MAXIMUM 325 WORDS TOTAL):**

**Overview** (40-50 words max)
Write 2-3 concise sentences capturing broad themes, traveler concerns, and discussion diversity. High-level snapshot only.

**Key Themes** (170-200 words max)
Identify the 3 most important travel topics using numbered format. For each theme:
- State theme clearly with specific examples
- 1-2 sentences with SPECIFIC details: exact destinations, costs, timeframes, visa requirements, accommodation types
- Be extremely specific - avoid generic terms
- Include concrete examples and actionable details
- Format each theme as: "1. [First theme content] 2. [Second theme content]" etc.

**Travel Implications** (80-100 words max)  
Provide 2 NEW strategic insights NOT repeating Key Themes using numbered format. Each point 1-2 sentences:
- Specific planning recommendations with timeframes
- Concrete safety or budget strategies with amounts/thresholds
- Tactical travel advice based on analysis
- Strategic frameworks with clear actions
- Format each implication as: "1. [First implication] 2. [Second implication]" etc.

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Do NOT include any sub-bullets, context sections, or engagement scores
- Do NOT repeat specific destinations, costs, or detailed advice from Key Themes
- Each Key Theme should be a clean paragraph without sub-sections
- Be extremely specific - always include exact destinations, costs, timeframes, visa details, and accommodation types when available
- Avoid generic language like "various destinations," "different approaches," "some travelers," "many countries"
- Travel Implications should provide higher-level strategic guidance answering "What should I DO differently when traveling?"

IMPORTANT: Use exactly the 3 section headers above (Overview, Key Themes, Travel Implications) with no additional formatting. Keep Overview concise (2-3 sentences), make Key Themes highly specific with concrete details, and ensure Travel Implications offers unique strategic value.

STRICT WORD LIMIT: Keep the entire summary under 325 words total - this is a hard limit. NEVER end mid-sentence. If a sentence would push you over the 325-word limit, DELETE that entire sentence and end cleanly with the previous complete sentence. Prioritize the most important and specific information. Be concise and eliminate unnecessary words while maintaining specificity.

SENTENCE COMPLETION RULE: Absolutely NO mid-sentence cutoffs. If you're near the 325-word limit:
1. Count words carefully as you write
2. If starting a new sentence would exceed 325 words, DO NOT write it at all
3. End cleanly with the last complete sentence
4. Better to have fewer complete numbered points than incomplete ones
5. REMOVE any sentence that would cause you to exceed the limit"""
