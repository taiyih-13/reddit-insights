                <p><strong>Content Preview:</strong> What the heck is Potus talking about?

Please explain...</p>

apple is solid and stable, but not exactly high growth anymore. bitcoin, on the other hand, feels riskier but has much higher upside potential. i&#x27;m in my 20s, so i can stomach some risk and i already have other investments in index funds (voo, etc.)

remaining positions: 

50 $1 calls for 7/25
30 $1 calls for 8/29 

those 198 $1 calls cost $1200.  rare i see a stock mentioned anywhere that doesn’t have big premiums.

about 2 thirds of our investment in in voo. the rest is in schd.

i know the advantage of schd is the dividend payment. but we’re getting way more growth from voo.

would it make sense to focus more on voo to build up the accounts. and then shift those funds (since it’s in a roth) over to schd once we get closer to retirement?

wondering if it’s as easy as helping them set up roth ira’s,  dropping everything in there, buying some voo, and telling them to forget it’s there for 40 years.

i’m sure it’s not that easy but i’d love some feedback on how you would handle if it were you.  

appreciate any insights ">
