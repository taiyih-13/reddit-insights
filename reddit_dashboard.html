             data-search-content="$kss short squeeze = options magic 🔥

stock ripped 100% on a short squeeze. cool. it happens all the time.   

but the real juice? the options.  
10 contracts of the 10.5c for $0.12 ($120 total)... they hit $9.20 per contract. that’s over $9k from pocket change.

how? 

* short interest + surprise move = squeeze fuel
* low iv going in, then boom — iv spike
* delta ramps fast when you go itm
* everyone piles in, market makers hedge, price launches 

this is why i mess with options on these setups">
