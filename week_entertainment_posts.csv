However, a movie which hit me with regret from the very first line of dialogue was ""The New Mutants"".

My standout favorite is Jude Law in ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’. That guy walked, talked, and breathed a Yank as Dickie Greenleaf.

From what I’ve observed over the years, British actors who do really successful American accents tend to come to Hollywood well-prepared and aiming at success.

One reason UK actors have a leg up on American actors is because they often have formal dialect training, which is why many outperform
their American counterparts attempting British accents. I’d go out on a limb to say American actors rarely match that level of authenticity.

The one exception is Forest Whitaker in ‘The Crying Game’. His British accent was so good, I thought the guy was born in the UK( He’s actually from Longview, Texas)  Go figure.  Any other examples of uncanny dialect delivery in a role?

At one point, other members of the group come and take her away from an actual captive, but they still continue to act like she's a captive as well long after they're away from the person. There is absolutely no reason for them to do this except to continue to dupe the audience into thinking this woman is a captive as well.

So, this got me thinking about other things like this. Another one I can recall is in a horror movie where the character on screen is facing to the left and the creature pops out from behind him in a jump scare that is SOLELY for the camera. The character would never have seen her or even knew she was there.

What are some other examples of this?

I was just a baby but I was in my baby bed or inside house when the outdoor scenes were filmed.  When the inside scenes were filmed, we stayed somewhere else.

Tobe Hooper wanted to use the house in his movie but hippy parents had been dodging the Vietnam draft and were growing a huge plot or weed to sell to the people around Austin.  A patch had just been planted and the first 5 inches had already sprouted.  

Tobe Hooper paid for the whole patch as if it was fully grown and ready to sale to have it all removed.

Futurama is back on September 15. The regular phoenix coming out of the ashes again.

Family Guy, yeah it's been on consistently, albeit with a bumpier release schedule than usual. Actually, it doesn't really deserve to be on this list, but it's most recent season has only just ended so it feels fair to include. I personally still need to catch up on the last few.

Well this is a bit of a surprise. I love Into the Spiderverse but I wasn't expecting it to take the win over Hereditary and The Favourite, or even Annihilation. But it is one of the best animated movies of the past decade and has huge widespread appeal so it makes sense as a winner from a popularity standpoint even if it may not be the ""best"".

Now onto 2017. I feel like Blade Runner 2049 is going to win this one by a good margin, given the demographics of this sub and how much Reddit in general loves that movie. 2017 is a pretty strong year though - we also have Get Out, Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name, Dunkirk and Logan, all of which are pretty well-loved as well. It would be nice to see a truly unexpected win here.

You watch this character go from manipulative dirtbag to a man who finds real purpose and comfort in giving dying soldiers hope. That final payer before the mass execution? Gut-punch. Chills.

I personally believe that more than one eyewitness is lying. Besides the two girls in the ship I really don't buy the other stories. What makes me doubt whether she was trafficked or not is her leaving her wallet and shoes behind. A missing pair of shoes would prove she exited the room by her own feet. Usually people don't bring too much shoe wear to a week trip in a ship- mostly sandals and something for the nightclubs. If my sister were missing and she left her shoes behind, I would search in the wardrobe in case she picked another pair of shoes. If this was the case, they would have mentioned it. 

 And if she was promised drugs like the navy said (I personally don't like that guy for a million reasons. Like wdym you didn't report it to extra military authorities asap. He's just, and I apologize for the language, a selfish scum) she would have taken her wallet and ID with her.

With three newcomers failing to make a good impression, ***Superman*** easily kept the top spot for a second weekend with a very solid second weekend drop. ***I Know What You Did Last Summer*** was the top newcomer, but it still wound up below expectations. ***Smurfs*** and ***Eddington*** also flopped, although that's hardly a surprise.

The Top 10 earned a combined $128.7 million this weekend. That's down 11.5% from last year, when ***Twisters*** led with a pretty great $80 million.

***Superman*** was still #1 with $58.4 million this weekend. That represents a 53% drop, which is solid for a comic book film. It's a bit steeper than ***The Batman*** (50.4%), but better than this year's ***Thunderbolts*** (56.4%). And much better than ***Man of Steel*** (64.6%).

One thing stuck with me is realising how much the film is really a comedy. Not overtly, there are no jokes, but the combination of a high brow speaking narrator and the juxtaposition of faces and silences, the use of ellipsis and the musical score, build a dry, existential and very British sense of humour.

I’m thinking that the typical way horror is filmed takes me out a little bit, like when the cinematography changes and I know something is coming.

I also rewatched the Ocean’s trilogy this week and the new original Ocean’s Eleven is almost 25 years old. But when you watch it it doesn’t seem like a product of its time. It could have been made a month ago and probably would look mostly the same.

It’s not just about taste, though, aesthetically, it does raise eyebrows when you walk into a man’s apartment and see walls plastered with Iron Man posters and shelves lined with Funko Pops. It feels like a missed opportunity. Your space is supposed to reflect your personality, your growth, your evolution. If you’re still decorating like a dorm room from 2012, it begs the question: has there been any growth at all?

Of course, people are free to enjoy what they want. That’s not the point. The point is that superhero obsession often feels less like interest and more like avoidance. It’s escapism dialed to 11. And while a bit of that is healthy in any life, there’s a difference between using it to unwind and using it to fill a void.

Nothing bloody/gory. This is the main throw-off for him, and I agree.

Nothing too violent either (as in, little gore but still everyone dies. My best example for this is the movie The Hitman's Bodyguard. We watched it and it was funny, but afterwards my dad commented on how violent it was).

Nothing overly funny, such as Brooklyn-99. It's not his type of humor.

Nothing Sci-Fi or Fantasy. He's not a fan of Fantasy world or generally anything with CGI and doesn't like when things get too ""complicated"" (his term for anything beyond modern technology, I guess).

Now the films itself is pretty interesting. In short, it's a tale about an aging dictator and his family facing the consequences of his bloody past, both politically and supernaturally. There have been a number of films based on the legend of La Llorona, but this is one of the few where the titular crying woman isn't a horrifying monster.

Sadly, it seems like they only went nuts on the visuals because the structure, characterisation (if you want to call it that), and third act stuff is all typical 'Marvel' stuff we've seen for the past several years.

As I noted in my own review: ""top quality actors and visual spectacle can only elevate subpar screenwriting by so much, and First Steps can’t overcome the usual Marvel shortcomings of a thinly-drawn villain, little to no actual stakes, and a third act filled with CGI mess.""

Not a bad movie per se, just a very.... serviceable one, but perhaps not the slam dunk or shot in the arm Marvel needs before banking it all on Avengers: Doomsday.

At first, I took the post-credit scene to mean that our Cinderella figure, Agnes, might not be such a good person after all.

That read made her feel complicit in the cruelty of the world around her - someone who used her beauty privilege to survive while turning away from real pain and responsibility.

The Austin Butler character and the mask virtue signalers were strawmen to illustrate that engagement farming isn't a problem that effects just the right - it targets EVERYONE.

I think Ari Aster is pointing to something more specific, though the stolen-land take is valid and not mutually exclusive to that which I present below.

**No Regrets For Our Youth** is from 1946, right after the end of WWII, and stars the immaculate Setsuko Hara as a young woman who has her life dramatically changed by the rise of fascism in Japan. It is the best Hara performance I think I've ever seen, and the entire movie was riveting. It may not quite be a five-star masterpiece like what Kurosawa would go on to make -- but it is damn close. Highly recommended! 

**One Wonderful Sunday** is from one year later, 1947. It follows a young couple as they try to enjoy a day to themselves in post-war Japan.

MC gets to be the chosen hero, MC gets all the magic powers, MC is capable of doing everything that can be done in that world, and the world basically only exists to be exploited by MC. Nothing about the world has any value in itself, it exists only to move MC's plot forward.

I like when the world building comes first, and then MC just happens to be there. MC is usually better written as a result, because they and those around them actually face challenges.

Hello guys. I love cinema, I think it's one of the best things to have happened to humanity. I have fallen in love with many different films from different directors.

If you were to ask me about the best film ever made, I would probably point to, ""2001 a Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick. However, my personal favourite is, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" from 1981 by Steven Spielberg.

Now, this is such a great film. It essentially tells the story of an American archaeologist who is trying to prevent the Nazis from obtaining a Biblical artifact that would enable them to become unstoppable.

This movie is such a rollercoaster from start to finish. It opens up in South America, and later moves on to Egypt. The archaeologist has to face various opponents on his path.

I was just curious, how well known is this movie? Is it critically appreciated or not? Do most people know it, and do they like it? What about you?

I cant make out the words but it almost sounds like ""trying to get you to stay"" and the last part is definetly a word that ends like ""ay"" (like stay or away or today) because he sings the last part for a bit like ""aaaayyy"" and then an electric guitar plays, and its 100% an electric guitar, for me accoustic guitars sound more ""round"" while electric guitars sound spiked and the sound is definetly spiked not round. and it individual notes, and it feels like the guitar is also layered i think. its like, this guitar that has 2 higher notes, then 3 notes that are more like in the middle and one note thats lower",Open,1m5n87q,0.6,3.0,242.0,3.0416666666666665,97.52269684277778,0.8161376209697906,221.7053042746893,Identification & Help,high

There is this TV show that I want to know its name (I'll share the reasons at the end). I haven't actually seen the show, just a commercial for it, where it showed a scene of the show. The scene goes as follows:

A woman (presumably the protagonist or one of the protagonists of the show) enters a bar. As soon as she steps in, the people in there start cheering. She gets all exited about it, until a guy shouts: ""Hey! Ramona!"". Turns out, the people were actually cheering for a woman right behind her (called Ramona). She then proceeds to the bar to get a drink, all bumped out about it, and says a few words. I don't remember what she says, but I believe it was something funny, since the show looked like it was a sort of funny sitcom.

Just to clarify, the ""Ramona"" character didn't seem important, just a random secondary character, the important thing was that the protagonist woman got happy people were cheering for her, just to find out it was for someone else.

There's this awesome comic anthology published by **World War 3 Illustrated** called **Now is the Time of Monsters**. The title is plucked from the Italian legend Antonio Gramsci, who wrote:

>“The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.”

Gramsci penned those words while imprisoned by Mussolini’s fascist regime in 1930. The quote later reached English readers through a translation by Marxist scholar Joseph Buttigieg. Yes, *that* Buttigieg, Pete's father.

Gramsci’s words capture a dangerous moment, between the tension of Communism and the spring of unfettered Capitalism, where the future hung in dangerous uncertainty. Hence the ""monster time"".

Bill Duke is left out of the conversation when it comes to leaving a mark on the neo-noir scene, which is a shame because there are some sequences in this film that are simply stunning, and masterful. His use of color (especially in some of the night scenes) are vivid - the use of buzzy neon lights just gets me goin'. And that tracking shot between Goldblum and Fishburne as they walk and talk along a catwalk to an office, and they disappear behind a bookcase, but we stick are tracking them/listening to their conversation - just cool stuff. And the conversation between Fishburne and the cop (reverend) under the deep red neon lights is just mesmerizing.

Also MCs who are confident and don't beat around the bush. If its romance then not something where MC is like kazuya from rent a gf lol. 

You know the usual trope where MC getting hit or just getting shit on etc. and either he is too meek, too shy, too introverted etc. that he never says anything back. 

Also not something where MC is just straight up coldhearted like sungjinwoo or mc of arifureta where they are just cold or emotionless to an extent. 

So please suggest me some animes and mangas that match the description.

I love almost all of Richard Linklater’s films. I've seen most of his movies at exactly the age I should have. When it comes to the Before Trilogy, seeing them when I did changed the way I thought about myself and relationships. 

Before Sunset has always been my favorite.

Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy balance the romanticized version of what happened in the previous movie with the reality of who the characters are 9 years later. They have experienced falling in and out of love, they have started to live their lives and become settled into the people they are. Love, and life, aren't just magical experiences to them any more but they are still able to see the magic in them.

But Bloom as an aspiring, but failing, actor who imagines he is a hard core combat vet is fucking hilarious beginning to end.

There's this part of a movie I remember where several business people are talking together. It's kind of a throwaway or background scene just to show how shallow they are.

I think the line I'm thinking of is, ""I could use one of these in my beamer!"" ""We could ALL use one of these in our beamers."" I think it was an air freshener or something. I think the first line is said by a woman and the second by a man and they all start laughing.

I thought it was BIG, but it's not in the script anywhere so I started looking at other places. It's not in American Psycho.

In this forum post from 2007, a discussion is held regarding Stephen Graham's white/Jamaican heritage and several cast/crew from This Is England (2006) contribute (including Shane Meadows himself).

It got me thinking about Death of the Author, and whether the actor's racial heritage is implicit to the character within the text PRIMARILY if it isn't directly addressed in the text itself.

Within the post, it is posited that perhaps the revelation of Graham's race was pre-emptive damage control or attempt to soften criticism (due to difficult themes within the film), whether it's adding too much complexity when having the character Combo be 'just' a Caucasian racist would suffice for the plot.

The man worries how he will be perceived, and we see how the young is received.
