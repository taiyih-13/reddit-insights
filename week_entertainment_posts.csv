However, a movie which hit me with regret from the very first line of dialogue was ""The New Mutants"".

My standout favorite is Jude Law in ‚ÄòThe Talented Mr. Ripley‚Äô. That guy walked, talked, and breathed a Yank as Dickie Greenleaf.

From what I‚Äôve observed over the years, British actors who do really successful American accents tend to come to Hollywood well-prepared and aiming at success.

One reason UK actors have a leg up on American actors is because they often have formal dialect training, which is why many outperform
their American counterparts attempting British accents. I‚Äôd go out on a limb to say American actors rarely match that level of authenticity.

The one exception is Forest Whitaker in ‚ÄòThe Crying Game‚Äô. His British accent was so good, I thought the guy was born in the UK( He‚Äôs actually from Longview, Texas)  Go figure.  Any other examples of uncanny dialect delivery in a role?

movies,"Most Egregious Case of ""For the Audience Only""",Gimetulkathmir,2143,0.95,708,2025-07-20 19:29:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1m4xr78/most_egregious_case_of_for_the_audience_only/,"My wife is currently watching a TV show and the episode is about a group of people who are kidnapping people and selling them. One of the women who is imprisoned is revealed to be the mastermind of the entire operation at the end of the episode. At one point, other members of the group come and take her away from an actual captive, but they still continue to act like she's a captive as well long after they're away from the person. There is absolutely no reason for them to do this except to continue to dupe the audience into thinking this woman is a captive as well.

So, this got me thinking about other things like this. Another one I can recall is in a horror movie where the character on screen is facing to the left and the creature pops out from behind him in a jump scare that is SOLELY for the camera. The character would never have seen her or even knew she was there.

What are some other examples of this?

I was just a baby but I was in my baby bed or inside house when the outdoor scenes were filmed.  When the inside scenes were filmed, we stayed somewhere else.

Tobe Hooper wanted to use the house in his movie but hippy parents had been dodging the Vietnam draft and were growing a huge plot or weed to sell to the people around Austin.  A patch had just been planted and the first 5 inches had already sprouted.  

Tobe Hooper paid for the whole patch as if it was fully grown and ready to sale to have it all removed.

He couldn't have mature marijuana plants in the outside scenes.  It was the early 70s.  No one would have put his movie in their theaters with bud growing in the fields.

It would have made one more unique part of the film in my opinion.

Family Guy, yeah it's been on consistently, albeit with a bumpier release schedule than usual. Actually, it doesn't really deserve to be on this list, but it's most recent season has only just ended so it feels fair to include. I personally still need to catch up on the last few.

Well this is a bit of a surprise. I love Into the Spiderverse but I wasn't expecting it to take the win over Hereditary and The Favourite, or even Annihilation. But it is one of the best animated movies of the past decade and has huge widespread appeal so it makes sense as a winner from a popularity standpoint even if it may not be the ""best"".

Now onto 2017. I feel like Blade Runner 2049 is going to win this one by a good margin, given the demographics of this sub and how much Reddit in general loves that movie. 2017 is a pretty strong year though - we also have Get Out, Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name, Dunkirk and Logan, all of which are pretty well-loved as well.

I personally believe that more than one eyewitness is lying. Besides the two girls in the ship I really don't buy the other stories. What makes me doubt whether she was trafficked or not is her leaving her wallet and shoes behind. A missing pair of shoes would prove she exited the room by her own feet. Usually people don't bring too much shoe wear to a week trip in a ship- mostly sandals and something for the nightclubs. If my sister were missing and she left her shoes behind, I would search in the wardrobe in case she picked another pair of shoes. If this was the case, they would have mentioned it. 

 And if she was promised drugs like the navy said (I personally don't like that guy for a million reasons. Like wdym you didn't report it to extra military authorities asap. He's just, and I apologize for the language, a selfish scum) she would have taken her wallet and ID with her.

With three newcomers failing to make a good impression, ***Superman*** easily kept the top spot for a second weekend with a very solid second weekend drop. ***I Know What You Did Last Summer*** was the top newcomer, but it still wound up below expectations. ***Smurfs*** and ***Eddington*** also flopped, although that's hardly a surprise.

The Top 10 earned a combined $128.7 million this weekend. That's down 11.5% from last year, when ***Twisters*** led with a pretty great $80 million.

***Superman*** was still #1 with $58.4 million this weekend. That represents a 53% drop, which is solid for a comic book film. It's a bit steeper than ***The Batman*** (50.4%), but better than this year's ***Thunderbolts*** (56.4%). And much better than ***Man of Steel*** (64.6%).

I'll start: The Outsider deserved a much larger audience.

It's actually scary at times but it's also laced with a quirky sense of humor. Not to mention I'll watch anything with Mare Winningham in it, and she's excellent here. Highly recommended.

This one was a big question mark as 2020 doesn't really have a lot of standout favourites. Very much a well-deserved win though. We're through with the 2020s and are now moving back into the 2010s. 

What is the best movie of 2019? This is a pretty strong year - we have Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Midsommar, Portrait of a Lady on Fire and The Lighthouse, all of which I could see take the W.

My personal choice is definitely Parasite, as cliched of a pick as it may be. It's one of those rare movies that I felt like was an instant classic as soon as I watched it, and it hasn't lost any of its power in the ensuing years.

It‚Äôs not just about taste, though, aesthetically, it does raise eyebrows when you walk into a man‚Äôs apartment and see walls plastered with Iron Man posters and shelves lined with Funko Pops. It feels like a missed opportunity. Your space is supposed to reflect your personality, your growth, your evolution. If you‚Äôre still decorating like a dorm room from 2012, it begs the question: has there been any growth at all?

Of course, people are free to enjoy what they want. That‚Äôs not the point. The point is that superhero obsession often feels less like interest and more like avoidance. It‚Äôs escapism dialed to 11. And while a bit of that is healthy in any life, there‚Äôs a difference between using it to unwind and using it to fill a void.

Sadly, it seems like they only went nuts on the visuals because the structure, characterisation (if you want to call it that), and third act stuff is all typical 'Marvel' stuff we've seen for the past several years.

As I noted in my own review: ""top quality actors and visual spectacle can only elevate subpar screenwriting by so much, and First Steps can‚Äôt overcome the usual Marvel shortcomings of a thinly-drawn villain, little to no actual stakes, and a third act filled with CGI mess.""

Not a bad movie per se, just a very.... serviceable one, but perhaps not the slam dunk or shot in the arm Marvel needs before banking it all on Avengers: Doomsday.

The Austin Butler character and the mask virtue signalers were strawmen to illustrate that engagement farming isn't a problem that effects just the right - it targets EVERYONE.

They both still seem so relevant, even though they are approaching 80 years old. 

**No Regrets For Our Youth** is from 1946, right after the end of WWII, and stars the immaculate Setsuko Hara as a young woman who has her life dramatically changed by the rise of fascism in Japan. It is the best Hara performance I think I've ever seen, and the entire movie was riveting. It may not quite be a five-star masterpiece like what Kurosawa would go on to make -- but it is damn close. Highly recommended! 

**One Wonderful Sunday** is from one year later, 1947. It follows a young couple as they try to enjoy a day to themselves in post-war Japan. The two main actors are SO, SO charming, and there's a scene with kids playing baseball that just left a big smile on my face.

Usually, MC is either dragged into or born into a fantasy world, and then the entire world revolves around that MC. MC gets to be the chosen hero, MC gets all the magic powers, MC is capable of doing everything that can be done in that world, and the world basically only exists to be exploited by MC. Nothing about the world has any value in itself, it exists only to move MC's plot forward.

I like when the world building comes first, and then MC just happens to be there. MC is usually better written as a result, because they and those around them actually face challenges.

Hello guys. I love cinema, I think it's one of the best things to have happened to humanity. I have fallen in love with many different films from different directors.

If you were to ask me about the best film ever made, I would probably point to, ""2001 a Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick. However, my personal favourite is, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" from 1981 by Steven Spielberg.

Now, this is such a great film. It essentially tells the story of an American archaeologist who is trying to prevent the Nazis from obtaining a Biblical artifact that would enable them to become unstoppable.

This movie is such a rollercoaster from start to finish. It opens up in South America, and later moves on to Egypt. The archaeologist has to face various opponents on his path.

I was just curious, how well known is this movie? Is it critically appreciated or not? Do most people know it, and do they like it? What about you?

Like, Spielberg has made many beloved films like Jurassic Park or Jaws or Savi",,1m4yiao,1.5,7.5,262.5,35.0,117.77741906499999,0.7824152860619937,231.63401259127335,Reviews & Discussions,high

I don't remember what she says, but I believe it was something funny, since the show looked like it was a sort of funny sitcom.

Just to clarify, the ""Ramona"" character didn't seem important, just a random secondary character, the important thing was that the protagonist woman got happy people were cheering for her, just to find out it was for someone else.

There's this awesome comic anthology published by **World War 3 Illustrated** called **Now is the Time of Monsters**. The title is plucked from the Italian legend Antonio Gramsci, who wrote:

>‚ÄúThe old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.‚Äù

Gramsci penned those words while imprisoned by Mussolini‚Äôs fascist regime in 1930. The quote later reached English readers through a translation by Marxist scholar Joseph Buttigieg. Yes, *that* Buttigieg, Pete's father.

Gramsci‚Äôs words capture a dangerous moment, between the tension of Communism and the spring of unfettered Capitalism, where the future hung in dangerous uncertainty. Hence the ""monster time"".

His use of color (especially in some of the night scenes) are vivid - the use of buzzy neon lights just gets me goin'. And that tracking shot between Goldblum and Fishburne as they walk and talk along a catwalk to an office, and they disappear behind a bookcase, but we stick are tracking them/listening to their conversation - just cool stuff.

Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy balance the romanticized version of what happened in the previous movie with the reality of who the characters are 9 years later.

Some years ago I used to be a huge anime fan (I've watched around 120 series), but because of college and growing up troubles I didn't have the time or the will to watch anything. However, around a month ago I started rewatching some of my favourite series (Bungo stray dogs, Haikyuu, Jujutsu kaisen...) in order to save my mental health and the passion and love for the world of anime came back.  

I watched the first 3 episodes of ""The summer Hikaru died"" and I fell in love with the atmosphere, animations, soundtrack and with the overall ""newer"" vibe. So my question is: what are the anime that are worth watching that came out in the past 5 years?

(I'll drop some series that I really liked if it can be of any help:  
Violet Evergarden, Kaguya-sama Love is war, Sonny boy, Given, Sasaki to miyano (I'd watch any BL to be honest), Psycho Pass, Evangelion, Tonari no kaibutsu-kun, Blue period (the manga>>>), Tokyo sinks 2020, Devilman Crybaby, Stars Align, Eresed, Magi (but ",What to Watch?,1m5166k,0.8,4.0,137.0,2.2142857142857144,115.9360301761111,0.7854225732214651,121.30289253134073,Recommendation Requests,high

It got me thinking about Death of the Author, and whether the actor's racial heritage is implicit to the character within the text PRIMARILY if it isn't directly addressed in the text itself.

Within the post, it is posited that perhaps the revelation of Graham's race was pre-emptive damage control or attempt to soften criticism (due to difficult themes within the film), whether it's adding too much complexity when having the character Combo be 'just' a Caucasian racist would suffice for the plot.
