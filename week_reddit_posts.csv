Are you esteemed investors expecting a crash when the most current tariff deadline arrives? The deadlines being August 1st although I've seen an August 12th date now.

The recent multiple threats by Trump concerning tariffs aimed at China and more recently Russia. And saying he will supply Ukraine with devastating weapons if they don't agree a peace have had no effect on markets. Infact I had an all-time high level of profits today. So could this realistically dull any crash in August to something barely noticeable especially since the economy doing better than expected and companies like Pepsi beating expectations.

The company updated its full-year revenue forecast, noting that it expects revenue to be between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion, up from a range of $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion. Netflix‚Äôs higher forecasts reflects the weakening of the U.S. dollar compare to other currencies as well as ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù member growth and ad sales, the company said in a statement.

Notably, this is the second quarter that Netflix is not releasing quarterly updates on subscription data.

Here‚Äôs how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $7.19 vs. $7.08, according to LSEG

 I am being kicked out now and I need to be gone by the end of the week. Looking for advice. I had a car that was in his name that I paid the down payment for but he is going to sell it and give the down payment back instead of giving it to me.

I live on the East Coast of the U.S. but I go to school in the Midwest and I‚Äôm going into my Senior year.

My biggest onetime buy was when BTC was around $13,000. It felt like a lot back then, and I had no idea what was coming. (0.5 BTC)

It seems like the excitement around Bitcoin has changed. ETFs have quietly built up huge holdings. Big companies have started keeping Bitcoin in their reserves without making noise about it. Even hotel chains and smaller businesses have joined in, silently buying in the background. But regular people mostly stood by, unsure if even $60K was already too expensive.

It feels like big institutions finally figured it out. They didn't talk loudly or create hype.. they just quietly bought Bitcoin. Most regular investors didn‚Äôt even notice.

I got into crypto in 2017 as literally the entire top 50 was starting to run (IIRC ETH to $50-70).

Held thru the 2018 short lived pumped to $3. Didnt sell a penny. Blockfolio said $6mm.

Held thru all the way until SEC sued Ripple and that shook me to the core. Couldnt hodl after that and sold. I still came out in significant profit from my initial capital.

Fast forward to today.  The problem has not been solved but they are making strides to get there.  They realized that can't just go in there guns blazing.  They need some Vaseline and a John Mayer, Sade, Keith Sweat and Juvenile Slow Motion playlist.

I had this one regular customer who was buying a lot of hardware from me. For one sale, which came to $1,500, he asked if he could pay me in something called ""Bitcoin."" I'd never heard of it and it sounded sketchy, so I turned him down and asked for cash.
He offered to pay in Bitcoin for several other sales after that, and I refused every single time. Looking back, given the amount of gear he was buying, he was almost certainly using the laptops for BTC mining.
At the time, that $1,500 payment would have been about 5 BTC.

Today, those 5 BTC would be worth over.... Never mind

Both the technical and fundamental set-up (34.5% short interest) makes this one of the best opportunities I have seen in a very long while. A price target of 10-15$ is very achievable.**

Two months ago I posted a 408K YOLO into IOVA with ten points of DD (I highly recommend you read this if you haven't already as I outline the basics of the company + main theses there): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k\_yolo\_into\_iova/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k_yolo_into_iova/)

Since then, the stock has risen over 80% on multiple positive updates and my position grew to 800K (after I also added \~12k shares). I believe that a few recent developments, however, are so substantial that they warrant a new post, and my conviction in the stock has never been higher.

I don't want this to get political. I'll just say that I'm generally not a trump fan...

That being said I believe Trump provides for easy ways to print money, and I'm going to try to get mine before the country comes crashing down.

Fundamentally, I think this administration pushes big policy. Policy that is capable of making or breaking industries. This administration also openly grifts and engages in quid quo pro on an unprecedented level. I believe that by taking advantage of these 2 patterns, we can make a ton of money.

To boil it down, I think that by being on top of administration policy, specific relevant dates regarding policy, bills, etc, we can find some big winners and losers. In terms of grift, being aware of companies with connections to the admin is also highly beneficial.

I'll give 2 examples I'm personally up a ton on. MP and TMC. Mainly I'll focus on MP because it was a higher conviction play for me. In my mind ",,1m3so26,2.0,10.0,4836.0,0.37561455260570303,129.814752935,0.7630380332549597,4173.651928820985,Market News & Politics,medium

Was out in the Grand Tetons dodging bears and overpriced bison burgers this week when I saw a local Wyoming news story on Ramaco Resources $METC. They just opened the Brook Mine on July 11 2025. First new rare earth mine in the US in over 70 years

CEO was on the news talking about how their rare earth deposit is easier to access than $MP. Said the material is in softer ground and they‚Äôre going to do processing onsite instead of shipping it overseas

He even compared it directly to $MP which already has deals with Apple and the DOD. That‚Äôs the kind of narrative that made $MP rip. And now the Pentagon is sniffing around Wyoming too

Meanwhile $METC is a coal company that already has strong cash flow. They‚Äôre not some cash burning startup hoping to maybe dig a hole. They‚Äôre mining now and using profits to fund this rare earth pivot

I‚Äôve had a wallet locked away since 2011 inside a small true crypt volume. For years it has taunted me since I couldn‚Äôt remember the password to the volume. I‚Äôve searched emails to see if I did something dumb and emailed it to myself. I didn‚Äôt but an email was sent to a friend one day after creating the volume saying I gambled all my bitcoin away. I almost gave up assuming it would be empty. A couple weeks ago I found an old keepass password file used around the same time. I couldn‚Äôt remember that password until today. Sitting at a light in my truck the light bulb in my head went off. I‚Äôm thinking to myself, is that the password? I got home and tried it and sure enough I got into the keepass database and inside it had the true crypt volume password. I couldn‚Äôt believe I still had 1.3 bitcoin in there.

Seems like Powell is getting hammered only because of Trumps insistence on lowering the rates. Powell otherwise has been highly regarded in how he's handled the economy (outside of the early mistake of ""transient inflation"" but he's otherwise navigated what everyone was assured would be a recession with masterful class).  
Getting back to El-Erians comment though, Powell resigning so Trump can appoint someone who will do his bidding seems to be the exact opposite of ""preserving Fed independence"".  What am I missing here?

I didn't need trading because I had any expenses due every month. Because of that, trading never felt forced for me. I didn't feel I HAD to make a ton of money to escape something. Trading was my escape, and I decided I wanted to get good at it. 

I started trading with around $800 that I made from holding nvidia stock for a few months. Had some beginners luck and turned it in $1100 in my first month which was insane to me. Then the greed hit, and I lost the majority of it over the course of a few months. But I never quit because I knew that everytime I won a trade, it would be essentially the same setup, I just had to figure out why I was losing.

Based on current volume and trend we could be sitting between $3-4 next week, you know, next week when we will have avoided delisting from the Nas due to being below the minimum bid price.

As soon as that is confirmed the algos will automatically buy, price action will go nuts $8-10 incoming

TIA for any assistance or advice...

So, I've been throwing $20/month into BTC for some time now, and am seeing what everyone here knows.  It's a great investment.  

My question is, how can I really make my investment strategy better moving forward, and if you all had any tips or advice that might help me continue to realize these profits, and, although I don't think I'll ever be a BTC millionaire necessarily, (certainly not at this rate) However, I'm getting older, and would like to have a decent nest egg in the next 10 years if possible.ü§ûüèª

Being on a fixed income, I don't have much in the way of income to invest, however, I've been considering trying a few things that might give me the ability to ramp up my investment. 

One think I'm considering, is changing my strategy, and instead of distributing my monthly investments into stocks and other crypto, to take all of my earmarked ""savings"" income just to BTC.

However, the government sold the Bitcoin in 2018, now worth over $25.24 billion, exceeding the country's public debt of $24 billion. Experts speculate that the sale was motivated by unfamiliarity with Bitcoin's value and volatility, and some believe that holding a long-term reserve of Bitcoin could have provided benefits.

Im not trying to say day trading doesnt work because it does, Its mentally demanding and emotionally demanding and requires enormous sacrifice. 

I have been living like a monk for almost 2.5 years trying to learn this craft. 

I got funded multiple times and have achieved 2 payouts so far but im questioning if this is for me or not. 

Not because of the money but im just unsure if I can remain mentally & emotionally disciplined for the rest of my career. 

If you did transition out of day trading, how did you do it. Its very hard to change a routine you have been doing for almost the last 3 years and it feels like its going to leave alot of emptiness in my routine. 

Any advice is appreciated?

He was there for over a decade, employer handled utilities and maintenance, but **never had an actual renter agreement**

He has no savings and our local housing authority does not have any public housing availability (wait-list also closed). I have stable income and would be able to cover deposits for my dad, but I'm not sure how either of us would pay his rent. 

Other notes: He does have Medicaid. We live in a low to medium cost of living town in VA. Average rent is around $1500 and haven't found anything less than $900. I don't have room in my tiny home to accommodate him. No family or friends available either.

KEY POINTS

The Port of Los Angeles says that shipping container traffic has increased as importers race to beat the latest deadlines set by President Trump for tariffs.

Trade from China, while short of a Covid-like surge, has been up ahead of the mid-August deadline for a deal which could raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%.

The Port of Los Angeles reported its best June ever for shipping container traffic, an increase in ocean freight that port executives described as a tariff whipsaw effect, with shippers racing to beat President Trump‚Äôs trade taxes, especially a mid-August deadline for tariffs on Chinese goods.

A total of 892,340 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were processed at the Port of Los Angeles in June, containers that were filled with holiday season and consumer replenishment products.

In a key shift, recent changes to environmental laws, particularly under the Trump administration, are set to weaken the demand for these credits. Essentially, regulatory credits have been a way for automakers who make gasoline-powered cars to avoid hefty fines for not meeting pollution standards. Companies like Tesla, which sell electric vehicles (EVs), have been able to make a nice profit by selling these credits to help the likes of GM, Ford, and Honda meet emissions targets.

But now, with the U.S. eliminating fines for automakers who fail to meet certain emission targets, the need for these credits is in sharp decline. Analysts are already slashing their forecasts for Tesla‚Äôs credit revenue, with some predicting it could fall by 40% in 2025 and hit rock bottom by 2027.

I started trading crypto in 2018. Like many, I got in with zero experience, thinking I‚Äôd get rich fast. Spoiler: I didn‚Äôt.

Bought TRX, XRP, and a bunch of random altcoins. Lost $2,700 in a few months. Then I tried margin trading (big mistake), got liquidated, and was left staring at an empty account. Honestly, I almost quit.

In 2019, I decided to stop gambling and start learning. I studied charts, watched real traders, read books, and backtested strategies. I didn‚Äôt trade real money for a while‚Äîjust practiced and journaled everything.

By 2020, I was finally making small profits. Took only setups I trusted, avoided hype, and managed risk properly. Made around $4,800 on a $3K account. Nothing crazy, but it felt earned.

2021 bull run? I was ready. I grew my account to over $43K trading ETH, SOL, and a few strong alts. But I got cocky, messed with leverage again, and gave back a chunk. That lesson hurt, but it stuck.

It really impacted companies like MSFT and NVDA which at the time was the right call to call that bluff.

But now, with GOOG coming out declaring it wants to spend upwards of 75% of its net income on CAPEX. Is it too much going forward?

GOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.

The bear case is straightforward: the company's iBuyer business model, which involves flipping houses for a fee, is poorly suited for the current ""frozen"" housing market. High mortgage rates have crushed transaction volumes, leading to staggering financial losses and a collapsed share price.¬†

The contrarian bull case argues that this very crisis has created a long-term opportunity. The downturn forced competitors like Zillow and Redfin to exit the market, leaving Opendoor as the ""last man standing"" with a de facto monopoly.

Healthcare ($IXHL) has been on an absolute tear ‚Äî up more than 300%, and surprisingly, very few are talking about it. Here‚Äôs why this move may be just the beginning and not just a pump:

‚∏ª

üî¨ 1. Clinical Trial Breakthrough ‚Äì IHL-42X

IXHL announced the completion of patient dosing in its Phase 2 trial for IHL‚Äë42X, a novel treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This is a huge milestone that positions the company for Phase 3 trials and potentially regulatory approval.

In June, they also finalized a ‚Äúdatabase lock‚Äù, which signals that results are now being prepared for analysis ‚Äî a major catalyst for any biotech stock.

‚∏ª

üìä 2. Massive Trading Volume

Trading volume recently exceeded 150 million shares in a single day ‚Äî a staggering number for a low-float micro-cap. This spike in volume suggests growing institutional interest or speculative accumulation ahead of potential news.

Most importantly both cloud AND AD revenue was up significantly showing no results of decline to ChatGPT.

The stock declined in afterhours for a brief moment because CAPEX increased from 75>85B but when Google explained that the demand for cloud and AI is so big they cannot service it! **Demand is outpacing their supply!!**\>> Simple terms - Google upped their investment to keep up with crazy demand! In fact Google announced on the earnings call they have a **backlog of 109B!!!**

Over the past few years, Netflix has vanquished the likes of Walt Disney, [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), and Apple in the battle to become the top videostreamer. Yet it‚Äôs slipping behind the company that has emerged as its biggest competitor: Alphabet‚Äôs YouTube.



This was hammered home on Thursday when Netflix reported second-quarter results. It earnings per share surged 47%. And according to Nielsen, its share of U.S. viewers remained at 8.3%‚Äîalmost twice as high as all of the Disney channels combined.



The problem: YouTube‚Äôs share of U.S. viewers grew to 12.8% from 9.9% a year earlier.

I've been ignoring it and only making minimum payments for too long. Recently, I came into an $18k inheritance and plan to set aside $10k for a house fund, as I intend to buy in the near future. The remaining $8k will go toward paying off my credit cards and establishing a small emergency fund.

I understand that paying off the entire debt and closing the cards could hurt my credit score. If I open a new card for recurring bills and recurring payments like subscriptions, would that help offset the hit? Or would it be more beneficial to pay the cards off gradually, in medium increments like $500 a month, focusing on one card at a time until they‚Äôre all paid off?

\--EDIT--

So my general incentive here is to 0 out debt and save the 170ish dollars in minimum payments towards savings. the goal is not to raise the credit score but hurt it as little as possible.

However, Silver is not even at all time highs. It has faded away from the concept of being an economic hedge (Gold is still king here). The use of silver in production is massive, we currently are using more silver than we mine.

No, it‚Äôs not Coca-Cola. It doesn‚Äôt have the same global brand equity.

At the top of Finviz you already have a screener, and you are going to use it to choose specific criteria (the ones you want), in my case:

üìò The Little Book That Beats the Market ‚Äì Key Ideas

1. Mr. Market offers prices daily‚Äîirrational in the short term, but right in the long run.


2. Stock prices can swing ¬±50% yearly, while business value changes ~5‚Äì10%.


3. Buy great businesses (high ROIC) at cheap prices (high earnings yield).


4. The Magic Formula = Rank by ROIC + Rank by Earnings Yield ‚Üí Buy top stocks.


5. The formula uses last year‚Äôs numbers‚Äîgood enough on average.


6. Avoid predictions‚Äîuse real, historical data instead.


7. Avoid micro-caps (< $50M market cap)‚Äîtoo risky and illiquid.


8. The strategy may underperform for 2‚Äì3 years‚Äîstay patient.


9. Over any 3-year period, the formula has historically beaten the market.


10. Use a margin of safety‚Äîbuying cheap protects against being wrong.


11. Own at least 20 stocks to reduce volatility.


12. With sector diversification and your own filtering, 8 stocks may be enough.


13. It‚Äôs better to own 5‚Äì8 stocks you know well than 30 you don‚Äôt.

Next-generation heirs are also driving the adoption of cryptocurrencies, pushing for digital diversification and embedding it into succession and estate planning.

Infrastructure decay/replacement cycle. The amount of bridges, roads, water systems, and power grids that need massive overhaul in the next decade is staggering, but most infrastructure plays still seem reasonably valued compared to tech darlings.

Nearshoring/friendshoring. Everyone talks about it, but I don't think the market has fully grasped how much manufacturing will actually move closer to end markets over the next 5-10 years. Supply chain resilience is becoming a strategic imperative, not just a cost optimization.

To calculate the sensitivity of stocks to this news, I first looked at which trading days the returns of the S&P 500 were dominated by tariff announcements. I used [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/economy/trump-tariff-timeline.html) to find the days on which important announcements were made.

What % of the following types of people fail at Day Trading?  Professional Day Traders, Students of day trading (at any stage of their day trading education), and gamblers who dabble in day trading. Everyone who has engaged in the activity of making a day trade, whether that be for 10 days, 10 months, or 10 years+ will be included.

What is the % of Day Traders who have  taken their Day Trading studies to an advanced level, who have learned their psychology, and risk management, who have learned/built strategies that match their personality, who have backtested, live tested, and adapted the strategies through various market cycles,  etc., How many of these Day Traders are successful?

When Netflix sells off at earnings, the forward returns for 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks has always underperformed the baseline in the past. That is not to say those forward returns are negative. The 2m S&P median is over 1%. It means that it returns lower than any randomly-selected normal mean/median window. 

In terms of actual trades, this is difficult, because volatility is very low. Short volatility not great. The netflix selloffs portend a very high amount of volatility for the stock itself.

I‚Äôve been keeping a close eye on ASML, and I noticed the stock has recently pulled back from its highs. Given its critical role in the semiconductor industry being the only supplier of EUV lithography machines used by TSMC, Intel, and Samsung. I'm wondering if this dip presents a solid buying opportunity for long-term investors.

ASML‚Äôs long-term fundamentals still seem strong:

The global demand for advanced chips is expected to grow exponentially with AI, data centers, autonomous vehicles, and high-performance computing.

Their tech moat is insane few (if any) competitors are close in terms of EUV capabilities.

Margins and revenue growth have historically been impressive.


However, I also see some potential headwinds:

Global semiconductor demand cycles can be volatile.

Geopolitical tensions with China (e.g., restrictions on chip exports) could have ripple effects.

I cant help but feel upset that my managed IRA is losing money but if I had just thrown this into the targeted fund I would be up 15% this year alone. Compounded over years that's substantial money.

 In such a monetary environment, hyper-speculative excesses are quickly exposed and forced to confront the market's real-time preferences. The market is guided by a real rate of return aligned with real interest rate. Consequently, even speculative growth stocks are expected to eventually turn a profit or be forced out of the capital market. Capital is indeed scarce, and conservatism is the name of the game. 

This is not at all the environment we see today. 

Sound economic calculation is almost impossible since  every single aspect of the pricing ecosystem is speculative and untrustworthy. It is all a giant casino of uncertainty that benefits Wall Street‚Äôs tendency towards securitization.

Healthcare stocks now are at their cheapest level relative to the overall market in 30 years following a tough first half for former industry leaders such as UnitedHealth Group, Merck , and Pfizer.

That could offer opportunities, since growth-oriented investors who once gravitated towards healthcare have pivoted to other sectors, notably technology, industrials, and even electric utilities.

The portfolio strategy team at Goldman Sachs ranks the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 index by absolute and relative price/earnings ratios.

Healthcare stocks now trade for 16 times forward earnings, compared to 30 for technology and 22 for the S&P 500 index. Most sectors are cheap versus their 10- and 30-year averages relative to the S&P 500 index, but health",Basics / Getting Started,1m62awy,1.0,5.0,337.0,0.6666666666666666,65.55030849055555,0.8723512359180642,327.68236650438763,Analysis & Education,medium

Would it make sense to focus more on VOO to build up the accounts. And then shift those funds (since it‚Äôs in a Roth) over to SCHD once we get closer to retirement? 

Thanks in advance!",,1m61lx8,1.2,6.0,310.0,10.2,66.0983640461111,0.8713557690352463,301.1202884009263,Personal Trading Stories,medium
