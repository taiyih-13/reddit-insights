My biggest onetime buy was when BTC was around $13,000. It felt like a lot back then, and I had no idea what was coming. (0.5 BTC)
My only real regret is not buying more during the dips or sometimes not buying at all out of fear. There were times I froze when prices dropped, and that hesitation probably cost me the most.

But here’s what I’m proud of:
✅ I’ve never sold a single sat. Not once.
✅ I bought at both lows and highs, and I’m still here.
✅ I plan to keep stacking. Slowly. Steadily. With conviction.

He offered to pay in Bitcoin for several other sales after that, and I refused every single time. Looking back, given the amount of gear he was buying, he was almost certainly using the laptops for BTC mining.

Both the technical and fundamental set-up (34.5% short interest) makes this one of the best opportunities I have seen in a very long while. A price target of 10-15$ is very achievable.**

I don't want this to get political. I'll just say that I'm generally not a trump fan...

That being said I believe Trump provides for easy ways to print money, and I'm going to try to get mine before the country comes crashing down.

Fundamentally, I think this administration pushes big policy. Policy that is capable of making or breaking industries. This administration also openly grifts and engages in quid quo pro on an unprecedented level. I believe that by taking advantage of these 2 patterns, we can make a ton of money.

To boil it down, I think that by being on top of administration policy, specific relevant dates regarding policy, bills, etc, we can find some big winners and losers. In terms of grift, being aware of companies with connections to the admin is also highly beneficial.

I'll give 2 examples I'm personally up a ton on. MP and TMC. Mainly I'll focus on MP because it was a higher conviction play for me. In my mind ",,1m3so26,2.0,10.0,4812.0,0.3751233958538993,110.4555692325,0.794441625280656,4304.053100850517,Market News & Politics,medium

Was out in the Grand Tetons dodging bears and overpriced bison burgers this week when I saw a local Wyoming news story on Ramaco Resources $METC. They just opened the Brook Mine on July 11 2025. First new rare earth mine in the US in over 70 years

CEO was on the news talking about how their rare earth deposit is easier to access than $MP. Said the material is in softer ground and they’re going to do processing onsite instead of shipping it overseas

He even compared it directly to $MP which already has deals with Apple and the DOD. That’s the kind of narrative that made $MP rip. And now the Pentagon is sniffing around Wyoming too

Meanwhile $METC is a coal company that already has strong cash flow. They’re not some cash burning startup hoping to maybe dig a hole. They’re mining now and using profits to fund this rare earth pivot

Realtors hate OPEN. But they’re literally shilling our bags on the lawns of open houses. You can’t buy this kind of marketing.

OPEN is doing what HOOD did for brokerages. They maximize convenience and speed, and minimize expenses and red tape. No contingencies, no agents, and 5 day close is pretty much the HOOD version of real estate investing.

Let’s address the elephant the room: the spreads. Will sellers get a worse deal than going through the painful 3-6 month process of selling through the traditional method and shaving 7% off for agents and middlemen? Most likely.

Back in late Feb, when the market was dipping, I cut my exposure by about half. Then in May, I sold almost everything. Altogether, I cashed out around 100K worth of positions.

If I had just held, my portfolio would probably be around 130K right now, which is about a 30 percent increase. But in April, it was down close to 75K. That’s almost a 60 percent swing. At the time, I just wasn’t in a place mentally to handle that kind of rollercoaster.

Some extra context:

* In Feb, I didn’t know if I’d need the money. My mediation got delayed, and I wasn’t sure if I’d have to keep fighting the case or not for another 2 years or so.
* By May, the case had worked itself out, but I still thought we were near a top.

The federal government has a initiative called the **Defense Authorization for Strategic and High‑Tech.** Speaking in terms of minerals initiative—it presents as an **investment/funding program** linked to the DoD (and also relevant to DPA, DOE) aimed at accelerating U.S. supply chains in critical minerals (like graphite, rare earths, etc.). It focuses on **grants, offtake agreements, and financial backing.** They also have a dashboard called FAST-41.

The recent multiple threats by Trump concerning tariffs aimed at China and more recently Russia. And saying he will supply Ukraine with devastating weapons if they don't agree a peace have had no effect on markets. Infact I had an all-time high level of profits today. So could this realistically dull any crash in August to something barely noticeable especially since the economy doing better than expected and companies like Pepsi beating expectations.

Powell otherwise has been highly regarded in how he's handled the economy (outside of the early mistake of ""transient inflation"" but he's otherwise navigated what everyone was assured would be a recession with masterful class).  
Getting back to El-Erians comment though, Powell resigning so Trump can appoint someone who will do his bidding seems to be the exact opposite of ""preserving Fed independence"".  What am I missing here?

The company updated its full-year revenue forecast, noting that it expects revenue to be between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion, up from a range of $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion. Netflix’s higher forecasts reflects the weakening of the U.S. dollar compare to other currencies as well as “healthy” member growth and ad sales, the company said in a statement.

Notably, this is the second quarter that Netflix is not releasing quarterly updates on subscription data.

Here’s how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

Back in 2019, I used profits from trading stocks to help buy a house in my home country in the Caribbean. I put down about $130,000 cash and took a mortgage for the remaining ~$130K.

When future fusion reactors print gold as a by-product of energy the gold supply will increase. The Bitcoin supply won't even if they try to use that energy to mine it. 

The most creative part of Satoshi's invention was arguably the addition of the difficulty adjustment to ensure that the Bitcoin supply schedule would stay on track even in the face of changing mining hashrate due to high Bitcoin demand or an abundance of energy. It's a mechanism that sets Bitcoin apart from most other supply/demand systems.

Brussels could agree to the so-called reciprocal levies to avoid the US President’s threat to raise them to 30 per cent from August 1, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times.

Both sides would waive tariffs on some products, including aircraft, spirits and medical devices, the people said.

The European Commission, which runs EU trade policy, briefed envoys from member states on Wednesday following talks with US counterparts.

The bloc’s exporters have been paying an additional 10 per cent tariff on goods sent to the US since April while talks between Washington and Brussels continued. That was on top of pre-existing duties averaging 4.8 per cent.

However, the government sold the Bitcoin in 2018, now worth over $25.24 billion, exceeding the country's public debt of $24 billion.

He's ready for discharge home, but just found out his employer has evicted him and terminated employment. The situation is a little odd since he's a groundskeeper and lives on company property with ""rent"" being taken out of his paychecks. He was there for over a decade, employer handled utilities and maintenance, but **never had an actual renter agreement**

He has no savings and our local housing authority does not have any public housing availability (wait-list also closed). I have stable income and would be able to cover deposits for my dad, but I'm not sure how either of us would pay his rent. 

Other notes: He does have Medicaid. We live in a low to medium cost of living town in VA. Average rent is around $1500 and haven't found anything less than $900. I don't have room in my tiny home to accommodate him. No family or friends available either.

In a key shift, recent changes to environmental laws, particularly under the Trump administration, are set to weaken the demand for these credits. Essentially, regulatory credits have been a way for automakers who make gasoline-powered cars to avoid hefty fines for not meeting pollution standards. Companies like Tesla, which sell electric vehicles (EVs), have been able to make a nice profit by selling these credits to help the likes of GM, Ford, and Honda meet emissions targets.

But now, with the U.S. eliminating fines for automakers who fail to meet certain emission targets, the need for these credits is in sharp decline. Analysts are already slashing their forecasts for Tesla’s credit revenue, with some predicting it could fall by 40% in 2025 and hit rock bottom by 2027.

As the title says I ended up getting rid of my financial advisor which I had for four years. I was getting charged quite a bit in fees seems like every 3 months I was being charged 150 to $180 for his Services also he had me invested in multiple ETFs which were not performing as well as I thought they would. I was only up about 12% after 4 years on total gain.  This is a Roth Ira btw

My question is - I'm trying to sell off all these bad performing ETFs that he had me invested in and invest in basically a two to three fund Etf portfolio. 

So far I have bought since selling other etfs 80% in vti and 20% in fbtc

Any reason to add a third etf? 

Also the best performing etf he had I kept so far is Spyg. Which I'm up 35% in 4 years. Should I hang on to this or sell and buy more vti? I'm 32 years old

Thanks for any advice. I believe I did the right thing. ",,1m3brlc,1.2,6.0,981.0,0.9391891891891891,125.02779145472222,0.7706857581100469,854.1427287059561,Personal Trading Stories,medium

But this indicator somehow worked for me and it actually got me super interested in other indicators that apply similar concepts like it.

It’s called the KDE Optimized RSI, and what makes it so unique is that it studies what the RSI was at previous pivot highs and lows.

Just being honest…that day never comes. Yes, those feelings aren’t as strong…. but they never completely disappear.

Even traders that mentored me who’ve been consistently profitable at firms making millions for years still experience the same emotional impulses.
We all still feel that itch to jump in early. We still get a little too hopeful sometimes when holding a position.

Bought TRX, XRP, and a bunch of random altcoins. Lost $2,700 in a few months. Then I tried margin trading (big mistake), got liquidated, and was left staring at an empty account. Honestly, I almost quit.

In 2019, I decided to stop gambling and start learning. I studied charts, watched real traders, read books, and backtested strategies. I didn’t trade real money for a while—just practiced and journaled everything.

By 2020, I was finally making small profits. Took only setups I trusted, avoided hype, and managed risk properly. Made around $4,800 on a $3K account. Nothing crazy, but it felt earned.

2021 bull run? I was ready. I grew my account to over $43K trading ETH, SOL, and a few strong alts. But I got cocky, messed with leverage again, and gave back a chunk. That lesson hurt, but it stuck.

2022 was survival mode. I traded less, avoided trying to “buy the d",Advice,1m4ge9a,1.8,9.0,862.0,0.45294117647058824,91.74168034361111,0.8260264363426618,798.2347881273745,Questions & Help,high

The bear case is straightforward: the company's iBuyer business model, which involves flipping houses for a fee, is poorly suited for the current ""frozen"" housing market. High mortgage rates have crushed transaction volumes, leading to staggering financial losses and a collapsed share price. 

The contrarian bull case argues that this very crisis has created a long-term opportunity. The downturn forced competitors like Zillow and Redfin to exit the market, leaving Opendoor as the ""last man standing"" with a de facto monopoly. A closer look at the financials reveals a pivot towards profitability, with improving margins and a forecast for positive adjusted EBITDA in the near future.

I was focused on earning it and saving it, not actually making it grow.

The book’s bit about assets versus liabilities made me seriously reconsider what I thought was “investing.” I always assumed things like my car or house were assets, but if they keep draining money, they’re actually liabilities.

The concept of having an algorithm evaluate the property prices by accounting for number of bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities, future value projections, and local housing market trends sounds enticing at first... if it wasn't for the fact that it has proven to be highly ineffective.

Over the past two months, Incannex 
Healthcare ($IXHL) has been on an absolute tear — up more than 300%, and surprisingly, very few are talking about it. Here’s why this move may be just the beginning and not just a pump:

⸻

🔬 1. Clinical Trial Breakthrough – IHL-42X

IXHL announced the completion of patient dosing in its Phase 2 trial for IHL‑42X, a novel treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This is a huge milestone that positions the company for Phase 3 trials and potentially regulatory approval.

In June, they also finalized a “database lock”, which signals that results are now being prepared for analysis — a major catalyst for any biotech stock.

⸻

📊 2. Massive Trading Volume

Trading volume recently exceeded 150 million shares in a single day — a staggering number for a low-float micro-cap. This spike in volume suggests growing institutional interest or speculative accumulation ahead of potential news.

Over the past few years, Netflix has vanquished the likes of Walt Disney, [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), and Apple in the battle to become the top videostreamer. Yet it’s slipping behind the company that has emerged as its biggest competitor: Alphabet’s YouTube.



This was hammered home on Thursday when Netflix reported second-quarter results. It earnings per share surged 47%. And according to Nielsen, its share of U.S. viewers remained at 8.3%—almost twice as high as all of the Disney channels combined.



The problem: YouTube’s share of U.S. viewers grew to 12.8% from 9.9% a year earlier.

Meanwhile, the macro picture is getting shakier:

* The U.S. is running a **7% deficit** — *during* good times
* **Tariff uncertainty** is rising again, which could hit global trade
* **Higher interest rates are sticking around longer** than many expected
* The **crypto space feels frothy again** — a lot of bank earnings MA, trading IPO is currently driven by Crypto craze

However, Silver is not even at all time highs. It has faded away from the concept of being an economic hedge (Gold is still king here).

The remaining $8k will go toward paying off my credit cards and establishing a small emergency fund.

I understand that paying off the entire debt and closing the cards could hurt my credit score. If I open a new card for recurring bills and recurring payments like subscriptions, would that help offset the hit? Or would it be more beneficial to pay the cards off gradually, in medium increments like $500 a month, focusing on one card at a time until they’re all paid off?

So my general incentive here is to 0 out debt and save the 170ish dollars in minimum payments towards savings. the goal is not to raise the credit score but hurt it as little as possible.

This move, funded through their at-the-market (ATM) offering (~$3.6M), significantly reduces dilution risk and helps clean up the capital structure.

🔹 Why this matters:
	•	These warrants were issued just a couple months ago (May 2025), so taking them off the table now shows urgency to restore investor confidence.
	•	This follows their planned 1-for-200 reverse ADS split, part of efforts to maintain Nasdaq compliance and reframe the stock’s optics.
	•	Biotechs often suffer from overhang issues — NCNA is actively working to eliminate those.

📊 Price action:
	•	Stock rallied ~7% intraday, and after-hours showed another ~13% spike.
	•	Could see a technical breakout if volume holds this week.

💡 The setup:
	•	Tiny float, penny-level pricing, short interest rising, and now less dilution risk.

The first two weeks of this month? Flat. 0% profit. Not a loss, not a win ,just neutral boredom. A few years ago, that would’ve made me spiral into overtrading or forcing setups that weren’t there. But this time, I did something different: I stayed disciplined.

It really impacted companies like MSFT and NVDA which at the time was the right call to call that bluff.

But now, with GOOG coming out declaring it wants to spend upwards of 75% of its net income on CAPEX. Is it too much going forward?

GOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.

A bigger concern is that all this infrastructure has a high attrition rate. Servers need replacing on a 5 year cycle. So the likelihood expensive buildouts now will persist later is a problem as well.

We're talking about one of the most consistent, dominant names in the entire healthcare sector. Revenue, cash flow, margins—all still solid. Sure, the Optum headlines spooked people, but let’s be real: the market’s reaction seems overdone.

Stock is down over 20% from its highs and trading at a forward P/E it hasn’t touched in years. Not saying it’s risk-free, but at this valuation? It’s hard to ignore.

I’m not going all in or anything, but I started building a position. If you’re already diversified, having some exposure to a name like $UNH at these levels feels like a smart long-term bet. This is the kind of stock that doesn't stay cheap for long.

📘 The Little Book That Beats the Market – Key Ideas

1. Mr. Market offers prices daily—irrational in the short term, but right in the long run.


2. Stock prices can swing ±50% yearly, while business value changes ~5–10%.


3. Buy great businesses (high ROIC) at cheap prices (high earnings yield).


4. The Magic Formula = Rank by ROIC + Rank by Earnings Yield → Buy top stocks.


5. The formula uses last year’s numbers—good enough on average.


6. Avoid predictions—use real, historical data instead.


7. Avoid micro-caps (< $50M market cap)—too risky and illiquid.


8. The strategy may underperform for 2–3 years—stay patient.


9. Over any 3-year period, the formula has historically beaten the market.


10. Use a margin of safety—buying cheap protects against being wrong.


11. Own at least 20 stocks to reduce volatility.


12. With sector diversification and your own filtering, 8 stocks may be enough.


13. It’s better to own 5–8 stocks you know well than 30 you don’t.

Infrastructure decay/replacement cycle. The amount of bridges, roads, water systems, and power grids that need massive overhaul in the next decade is staggering, but most infrastructure plays still seem reasonably valued compared to tech darlings.

Nearshoring/friendshoring. Everyone talks about it, but I don't think the market has fully grasped how much manufacturing will actually move closer to end markets over the next 5-10 years. Supply chain resilience is becoming a strategic imperative, not just a cost optimization.

1) This is the first SPAC I’ve been involved with that didn’t go well for me. I genuinely believed that the association with Donald Trump Jr. would propel the stock to the next level. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case.

2) What’s even more disappointing is the silence from all sides—there’s been no communication or reassurance from investors or Don Jr. himself, especially as PEW continues to underperform. That silence speaks volumes.

BULL and DJT didn’t spike 10–15 days in either, but I thought DJT would have his son’s back by now. Instead, it seems like the Epstein list drama has taken priority and drawn Trump’s attention elsewhere.

When Netflix sells off at earnings, the forward returns for 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks has always underperformed the baseline in the past. That is not to say those forward returns are negative. The 2m S&P median is over 1%. It means that it returns lower than any randomly-selected normal mean/median window.

I’ve been keeping a close eye on ASML, and I noticed the stock has recently pulled back from its highs. Given its critical role in the semiconductor industry being the only supplier of EUV lithography machines used by TSMC, Intel, and Samsung. I'm wondering if this dip presents a solid buying opportunity for long-term investors.

ASML’s long-term fundamentals still seem strong:

The global demand for advanced chips is expected to grow exponentially with AI, data centers, autonomous vehicles, and high-performance computing.

Their tech moat is insane few (if any) competitors are close in terms of EUV capabilities.

Margins and revenue growth have historically been impressive.


However, I also see some potential headwinds:

Global semiconductor demand cycles can be volatile.

Geopolitical tensions with China (e.g., restrictions on chip exports) could have ripple effects.

The stock still isn’t exactly “cheap” by traditional valuation metrics.

I ripped the check up and left. But to be honest, she sounded like she was just saying whatever she thought I wanted to hear. So I don't trust what she said.

Now thinking of putting 70% into VOO.


The plan:


	•	Keep 1 year of emergency savings in HYSA just in case anything happens early on
	•	After that, drop it to 6 months since I’ll be past the short-term capital gains window
	•	If I need the money later (house, job loss, etc), I’ll sell and pay capital gains — 15% if held over a year



I know the market can drop, worst drop in VOO was 2020 at -20%, but it recovered fast. Even the dot-com crash took ~7 years, but the market bounced back. Today feels more diversified and resilient.


Also, taxes only apply to gains, not principal so I can never actually lose my original amount to taxes. It’s a gamble, sure, but one that’s been paying more than the 4% I get from my HYSA.


Meanwhile, I’ve been waiting for a housing crash that never came. Prices doubled. I feel like I’m falling further behind by sitting on cash.

Looking for Cheap Stocks? Healthcare Shares Haven’t Looked This Good in 30 Years. - Barron’s 

By  Andrew Bar
July 21, 2025

Healthcare stocks now are at their cheapest level relative to the overall market in 30 years following a tough first half for former industry leaders such as UnitedHealth Group, Merck , and Pfizer.

That could offer opportunities, since growth-oriented investors who once gravitated towards healthcare have pivoted to other sectors, notably technology, industrials, and even electric utilities.

The portfolio strategy team at Goldman Sachs ranks the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 index by absolute and relative price/earnings ratios.

Healthcare stocks now trade for 16 times forward earnings, compared to 30 for technology and 22 for the S&P 500 index. Most sectors are cheap versus their 10- and 30-year averages relative to the S&P 500 index, but health",Basics / Getting Started,1m62awy,1.0,5.0,320.0,0.6447368421052632,46.19112478805555,0.9082537219304871,322.6411910177559,Analysis & Education,medium

I was recently hospitalized for three days due to health issues. I received my bill which is $14,680. I have nearly 22k in savings. I love saving money and have been doing so to afford an apartment with my girlfriend. I ended my insurance not too long ago because they were covering my therapy appointments but then sent me a letter saying I owed them money for the amount they covered? Don’t get it. 

Anyways, I’m a 22 year old full time college student and I also work part time in retail and make $14.73 an hour, but I’ve been out of work the last three weeks while I figure out what’s wrong with me because the hospital was zero help. The hospital is helping me apply for Medicaid so I can have some assistance in paying off my medical debt but I have a feeling I’m going to be denied due to the amount of money I have in my savings. 

If I end up having to pay on my own, how can I pay off this debt without losing a huge chunk of my savings? I live with my grandparents so I really ",Insurance,1m6y7q0,0.8,4.0,303.0,0.8676470588235294,21.572235899166667,0.9560527801208671,319.9839923766228,Questions & Help,medium

Hi all, the issue was I mistakenly entered on an AM contract which is the reason the account lost value, the AM contracts opened ITM which resulted in a net loss and is the reason for the loss of value in the account. 

There was no account issue like I assumed, it was myself entering into the wrong contract

Original:


I’m not waiting for an account resolution on a ticket because I simply do not trust them.

My IBKR account closed and took 6000 dollars from me after a profitable bear call spread on spx. (This is incorrect as the trades were AM which meant that it would have expired ITM) 

I woke up a morning to find my account to have dropped from just under 16k to 10k. I am extremely confused and worried. My trade was profitable. It was never breached once. My account had shares liquidated 2 days after the trade.

I cannot for the life of me get what in the absolute hell they are doing behind the scenes.

I entered into 14 contracts with a strike of 6320-6325 bear call spread",,1m55bsh,1.0,5.0,328.0,1.0185185185185186,71.64140256583333,0.861351232659578,315.3232043123416,Personal Trading Stories,medium

Hey everyone, I'm a long-time (mostly) lurker who was getting close to my FIRE goals when I found myself staring down the business end of a layoff yesterday.  There's some gratitude, some humble brag and a whole lot of privilege and (for this sub) cliches to this post, so no hard feelings if you want to skip this one.

I'm 48M married to a 47F with two teenage kids.  I've been working various roles in the tech industry since I graduated debt free from an ivy league school in the late nineties.  That's (at least) one huge step up I've had in life.  I didn't learn about FIRE as a movement / concept until at least 7 or 8 years ago, but I've always saved and invested more than I earned.  Sure there were months were there were emergencies or a big budget item but on the whole that's been my natural approach to money and it has paid off.
