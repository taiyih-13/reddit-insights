Honestly, I wasn't even surprised.

It seems like the excitement around Bitcoin has changed. ETFs have quietly built up huge holdings. Big companies have started keeping Bitcoin in their reserves without making noise about it. Even hotel chains and smaller businesses have joined in, silently buying in the background. But regular people mostly stood by, unsure if even $60K was already too expensive.

It feels like big institutions finally figured it out. They didn't talk loudly or create hype.. they just quietly bought Bitcoin. Most regular investors didn’t even notice.

It took me nearly 4 years. I started in September 2020 with small, inconsistent buys, not really knowing where this journey would take me.

My biggest onetime buy was when BTC was around $13,000. It felt like a lot back then, and I had no idea what was coming. (0.5 BTC)
My only real regret is not buying more during the dips or sometimes not buying at all out of fear. There were times I froze when prices dropped, and that hesitation probably cost me the most.

But here’s what I’m proud of:
✅ I’ve never sold a single sat. Not once.
✅ I bought at both lows and highs, and I’m still here.
✅ I plan to keep stacking. Slowly. Steadily. With conviction.

This 1 BTC isn’t just a number, it’s a milestone. A reminder of everything I’ve learned, every doubt I’ve overcome, and every late-night rabbit hole I’ve gone down.

Stay humble. Stay curious. Stack sats.

Its time to share your biggest crypto blunders. Whether its stolen crypto, lost in a trade, sold too early, etc…Let it out here and suffer with your bros.

I’ll start:
I got into crypto in 2017 as literally the entire top 50 was starting to run (IIRC ETH to $50-70). My trade thesis was simple: “what hasnt pumped yet?” did about a days worth of research and subsequently dumped $20k into XRP. First got in about $10k in at 0.006 cents and it pumped to like 7cents a week later. Bought another $10k on the retrace back to 2.5cents. 

Held thru the 2018 short lived pumped to $3. Didnt sell a penny. Blockfolio said $6mm.

Held thru all the way until SEC sued Ripple and that shook me to the core. Couldnt hodl after that and sold. I still came out in significant profit from my initial capital.

People have been in since IPOB.   Well, have you been in IPOB so early that you were trading IPOB for profit on the low volume?  Well, I was, since the early, early days.  THEN it was announced that IPOB = Opendoor, which I took as a divine sign, as I'm deeply involved in Real Estate and saw the problem they solved.  Five fucking years I've been in this thing and looked at it inside out, while averaging down.

Fast forward to today.  The problem has not been solved but they are making strides to get there.  They realized that can't just go in there guns blazing.  They need some Vaseline and a John Mayer, Sade, Keith Sweat and Juvenile Slow Motion playlist.

Both the technical and fundamental set-up (34.5% short interest) makes this one of the best opportunities I have seen in a very long while. A price target of 10-15$ is very achievable.**

Two months ago I posted a 408K YOLO into IOVA with ten points of DD (I highly recommend you read this if you haven't already as I outline the basics of the company + main theses there): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k\_yolo\_into\_iova/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k_yolo_into_iova/)

Since then, the stock has risen over 80% on multiple positive updates and my position grew to 800K (after I also added \~12k shares). I believe that a few recent developments, however, are so substantial that they warrant a new post, and my conviction in the stock has never been higher.

I had this one regular customer who was buying a lot of hardware from me. For one sale, which came to $1,500, he asked if he could pay me in something called ""Bitcoin."" I'd never heard of it and it sounded sketchy, so I turned him down and asked for cash.
He offered to pay in Bitcoin for several other sales after that, and I refused every single time. Looking back, given the amount of gear he was buying, he was almost certainly using the laptops for BTC mining.
At the time, that $1,500 payment would have been about 5 BTC.

Today, those 5 BTC would be worth over.... Never mind

Now it feels like every crisis just leads to the same response: **Printing more money.**

They just keep rolling it over,, kick the can down the road.

That being said I believe Trump provides for easy ways to print money, and I'm going to try to get mine before the country comes crashing down.

Fundamentally, I think this administration pushes big policy. Policy that is capable of making or breaking industries. This administration also openly grifts and engages in quid quo pro on an unprecedented level. I believe that by taking advantage of these 2 patterns, we can make a ton of money.

To boil it down, I think that by being on top of administration policy, specific relevant dates regarding policy, bills, etc, we can find some big winners and losers. In terms of grift, being aware of companies with connections to the admin is also highly beneficial.

Was out in the Grand Tetons dodging bears and overpriced bison burgers this week when I saw a local Wyoming news story on Ramaco Resources $METC. They just opened the Brook Mine on July 11 2025. First new rare earth mine in the US in over 70 years

CEO was on the news talking about how their rare earth deposit is easier to access than $MP. Said the material is in softer ground and they’re going to do processing onsite instead of shipping it overseas

He even compared it directly to $MP which already has deals with Apple and the DOD. That’s the kind of narrative that made $MP rip. And now the Pentagon is sniffing around Wyoming too

Meanwhile $METC is a coal company that already has strong cash flow. They’re not some cash burning startup hoping to maybe dig a hole. They’re mining now and using profits to fund this rare earth pivot

I am from the class of 2016. Back then the 21 btc was the goal to have. Because you will own 1 millionth of the total supply obviously.

You are not my exit liquidity. This was never a ponzi scheme. I never sold, even when my stack will probably hit 3 million soon. 

I never stopped stacking. My last buy was still at $117k. I don't DCA, just lump sum in.   
Also this post is to prove /r buttcoiners wrong. I don't sell for fiat. The world is financially changing. We are part of it. 

I have a regular job, just like any other person. My income is around $6000 per month. I do my usual things and save the rest to buy bitcoin. Don't forget to live your life.

\-Overextended rally with no drawdowns

\-Bad earnings (INTC, TSLA, DOW) are actually getting shit on, while good earnings results (GOOG, NOW) are only resulting in moderate rises

\-Every recent candle has long tails from drawdown before ending slightly up

\-Friday, perfect time for profit taking (Within this recent rally, 4 out of the 5 last Fridays have posted losses)

\-Trump making boneheaded visit to pressure my king J. Pow into submission

\-I've already bought these puts and can't reverse them before they half in value tomorrow morning

However, I am not **THAT** regarded. I've placed my puts firmly ITM to avoid theta burn if more bullshit chop happens. Got a pretty good time too, even a flat move will turn a mild profit. Godspeed to me and to you, fellow regards.

SharpLink Gaming, Inc. ($SBET) is a compelling play for WallStreetBets investors seeking high-risk, high-reward exposure to Ethereum (ETH). Here’s my case:

Current stock price: $29.

Ranking in highest holdings of ETH - #2 (soon #1 and already above ETH foundation) - https://www.strategicethreserve.xyz/

Value Proposition: SBET is raising $5 billion to buy ETH, holding 280,706 ETH ($840M at $3,000/ETH) and purchasing ~14,931 ETH/day. They could complete their target by December 2025, owning ~1.67M ETH.

ETH Price Catalyst: when ETH hits $8,000 by year-end (bear case imo), SBET’s holdings would be worth $13.34 billion. With a market-to-net-asset-value (mNAV) of 2, SBET’s market cap could reach $26.68 billion, it’s currently at <$2b

Price Targets;
  - Neutral: $133–$177/share (150M shares).
  - Bullish: $666/share (50M shares, mNAV 2.5).

Musk’s EV maker reported a 16% decline in automotive revenue from a year earlier to $16.7 billion. Total revenue fell 12% to $22.5 billion from $25.5 billion a year earlier, missing the average analyst estimate of $22.74 billion, according to LSEG.

Tesla has been facing rising competition in key markets like China and Europe, especially from lower cost Chinese EV players. In early July, Tesla reported a 14% year-over-year slide in vehicle deliveries to 384,000 for the second quarter.

One of the first things I did was get a new cell phone number in the city I was planning to settle down in.

Almost immediately, I started getting calls and texts from debt collectors, always for a woman I had never heard of. I don’t remember the name now, but the calls were relentless. At first it was polite messages asking her to call back. I would tell them, “I just got this number. I don’t know who that is.” But the calls didn’t stop. They intensified. Over the next few years, I started getting messages saying it was my “final opportunity to settle before a lawsuit.”

Then, in 2019, five years into this, I get a call from a very professional-sounding young woman who says she’s a paralegal calling on behalf of a law firm to collect on a recent legal judgment. I asked for her full name and the law firm, repeated it back, and wrote it all down. Then I calmly said:

Profit was a miss.  
Revenue is down 12 percent year over year.

This is the important lesson on Tesla. It was a great story many years ago. People thought Elon was all that mattered.

The stock is at the same price it was in 2021. It has gone nowhere for four years.

I made a statement in our 24/7 community right after the earnings release. I said we are going to wake up 10 to 20 years from now and Tesla will still be below its current all-time high. Or if it happens to make a new all-time high in the near future, it will not surpass the one it hit at the end of the last bull market.

It is not a software company. It is not a tech company. It is a car company. 90% of its revenue comes from cars. Go to the Tesla website. That is what it is.

I was behind for a while, but I currently have a total of 115k including both of those accounts, along with an old pension at 95k at 7% appreciation. 

During the discussion a user was surprised I was putting so much into the Roth and questioned why I was doing that. I explained I was behind, but also, I thought this was kind of the next step. They never responded and now it's got me wondering if I'm going about it wrong.

Only buy LEAPS when Fear and Greed index tanks to 25 or below.

Only sell LEAPS when Fear and Greed index pushes 65-75.

Whether prices keep running afterwards it's all noise.

When VIX spikes take positions. When VIX floors sell positions.

The hard part is being patient. The easy part is buying. The hard part is selling. Waiting as market keeps pumping, feeling missing out because prices are moving. Prices are actually irrelevant.

My parents weren't supporting me.  I was standing there, looking at $1.76 in my bank account.  I walked over and told the cashier I'd have to leave the cart, and she picked up a pack of ramen and raised an eyebrow.  I dunno how much a pack of ramen cost back then but it was enough.

1. ZERO warrants = no dilution hammer

They just canceled 59.5 million Series A warrants.

No dilution overhang, no dumping pressure.

They already completed a $3.6M ATM raise — it’s done.

➡️ Clean cap structure = ready to rip.



 2. Two cancer drugs in human trials

\* NUC-7738 (melanoma resistant to PD-1 inhibitors) – expansion phase ongoing, first data expected Q4 2025

\* NUC-3373 (solid tumors w/ pembrolizumab & docetaxel) – additional results coming late 2025

➡️ FDA guidance coming after expansion.

Even modest results = big upside.

options flow’s been good. 123k calls traded in a day (june 24). OI heavy at 12.50 and 15. if we break out, market makers gonna hedge, could pop quick. short interest is massive too, 33% of float. any positive news and this could squeeze.

fundamentals solid. rev up 151% YoY. guidance is 97% growth this year. they got 1.2B in backlog signed already, and they’re in over 10k QSR stores now. rumours going round they’re pitching mcdonalds drive-thru contract after IBM fumbled it. even a piece of that would be big.

3. **Push lower**
   * Stops out those early longs
   * Sets a new low to bait in more aggressive shorts

   * Breaks through internal structure
   * Stops out the fresh bears
   * Leaves behind an imbalance (FVG/iFVG)

KEY POINTS

The Port of Los Angeles says that shipping container traffic has increased as importers race to beat the latest deadlines set by President Trump for tariffs.

Trade from China, while short of a Covid-like surge, has been up ahead of the mid-August deadline for a deal which could raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%.

The Port of Los Angeles reported its best June ever for shipping container traffic, an increase in ocean freight that port executives described as a tariff whipsaw effect, with shippers racing to beat President Trump’s trade taxes, especially a mid-August deadline for tariffs on Chinese goods.

A total of 892,340 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were processed at the Port of Los Angeles in June, containers that were filled with holiday season and consumer replenishment products. The increase in containers was not a surprise after President Trump l",Industry News,1m623ir,2.0,10.0,995.0,0.16489361702127658,87.51140843888889,0.8333384354708435,829.1717432934893,Market News & Politics,high

In a key shift, recent changes to environmental laws, particularly under the Trump administration, are set to weaken the demand for these credits. Essentially, regulatory credits have been a way for automakers who make gasoline-powered cars to avoid hefty fines for not meeting pollution standards. Companies like Tesla, which sell electric vehicles (EVs), have been able to make a nice profit by selling these credits to help the likes of GM, Ford, and Honda meet emissions targets.

But now, with the U.S. eliminating fines for automakers who fail to meet certain emission targets, the need for these credits is in sharp decline. Analysts are already slashing their forecasts for Tesla’s credit revenue, with some predicting it could fall by 40% in 2025 and hit rock bottom by 2027.

GOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.

I started trading crypto in 2018. Like many, I got in with zero experience, thinking I’d get rich fast. Spoiler: I didn’t.

Bought TRX, XRP, and a bunch of random altcoins. Lost $2,700 in a few months. Then I tried margin trading (big mistake), got liquidated, and was left staring at an empty account. Honestly, I almost quit.

In 2019, I decided to stop gambling and start learning. I studied charts, watched real traders, read books, and backtested strategies. I didn’t trade real money for a while—just practiced and journaled everything.

By 2020, I was finally making small profits. Took only setups I trusted, avoided hype, and managed risk properly. Made around $4,800 on a $3K account. Nothing crazy, but it felt earned.

2021 bull run? I was ready. I grew my account to over $43K trading ETH, SOL, and a few strong alts. But I got cocky, messed with leverage again, and gave back a chunk. That lesson hurt, but it stuck.

Over the past two months, Incannex 
Healthcare ($IXHL) has been on an absolute tear — up more than 300%, and surprisingly, very few are talking about it. Here’s why this move may be just the beginning and not just a pump:

⸻

🔬 1. Clinical Trial Breakthrough – IHL-42X

IXHL announced the completion of patient dosing in its Phase 2 trial for IHL‑42X, a novel treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This is a huge milestone that positions the company for Phase 3 trials and potentially regulatory approval.

In June, they also finalized a “database lock”, which signals that results are now being prepared for analysis — a major catalyst for any biotech stock.

⸻

📊 2. Massive Trading Volume

Trading volume recently exceeded 150 million shares in a single day — a staggering number for a low-float micro-cap. This spike in volume suggests growing institutional interest or speculative accumulation ahead of potential news.

This company is still being valued like a high growth tech darling, when in reality, it is little more than a subprime auto loan originator cloaked in aggressive, misleading accounting practices.

Today, Oppenheimer, a firm that once stood for integrity in research, raised its price target on Carvana, projecting a 40 percent upside. In doing so, they have effectively trampled on the legacy of their own past.

What happened to the spirit of Steven Eisman and Vincent Daniels, who once sat in that very research department and dared to challenge consensus, who believed in asking uncomfortable questions, who fought to arm the little guy with the truth, even when it cost them access or popularity?

Now we see the opposite. A cheerleading upgrade, disconnected from risk, seemingly blind to the lawsuits, the related party transactions, the EBITDA mirage.

Netflix Earnings Show That YouTube Is the Streamer to Fear

Over the past few years, Netflix has vanquished the likes of Walt Disney, [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), and Apple in the battle to become the top videostreamer. Yet it’s slipping behind the company that has emerged as its biggest competitor: Alphabet’s YouTube.



This was hammered home on Thursday when Netflix reported second-quarter results. It earnings per share surged 47%. And according to Nielsen, its share of U.S. viewers remained at 8.3%—almost twice as high as all of the Disney channels combined.



The problem: YouTube’s share of U.S. viewers grew to 12.8% from 9.9% a year earlier. Whereas Netflix creates much of its own content and relies primarily on subscriptions, YouTube follows a different model that’s b",Stock Analysis,1m4dvj9,1.0,5.0,708.0,0.27424749163879597,135.2297417722222,0.7544784005451225,604.9707075859467,Analysis & Education,medium

At this point in my journey, I've refined and optimized my strategy to the point where I should scale up. But I'm not ready to do that just yet, because I am mentally not ready.

Trading is the hardest thing I have ever done. I'd like to think of myself as a level headed person, but the problem is that trading exposes your emotions and your thought process as an individual. It's almost like a therapist. Through trading, I've realized deep down that I can be impatient, I am stubborn, I'm not disciplined, and I hate being wrong.

However, I always blame myself for my losses. Every day is an opportunity to learn, adjust, and become better. That accountability has taken me this far, and has helped me continue pushing to be a part of that 1% that makes it.

I've been ignoring it and only making minimum payments for too long. Recently, I came into an $18k inheritance and plan to set aside $10k for a house fund, as I intend to buy in the near future. The remaining $8k will go toward paying off my credit cards and establishing a small emergency fund.

I understand that paying off the entire debt and closing the cards could hurt my credit score. If I open a new card for recurring bills and recurring payments like subscriptions, would that help offset the hit? Or would it be more beneficial to pay the cards off gradually, in medium increments like $500 a month, focusing on one card at a time until they’re all paid off?

\--EDIT--

So my general incentive here is to 0 out debt and save the 170ish dollars in minimum payments towards savings. the goal is not to raise the credit score but hurt it as little as possible.

With all this crypto hype dragging in fresh blood again, here’s a little guidance to help avoid screwing yourself over.

* **Hold that shit**: If you actually believe your coin’s got long-term value: **JUST HOLD**. Ignore the noise and don't sell unless some *real* bad news drops (Key partners exit, serious exploit, insolvency, lost legal challenges, etc). Even then, the price will likely climb back up unless it's some irrecoverable problem or it was just a rug-pull crypto in the first place.
* **Do some damn research**: Look up reasons why your crypto of choice has value, what its downsides are, etc. Is it because Logan Paul hyped it up, or is it because the team behind it have are *actively* and *visibly* working on a bigger plan? Find that shit out first before putting money in it.
* **Resist FOMO**: Seems obvious, but when you see a price start climbing like crazy, your first impulse is to ""BUY NOW"", ",DISCUSSION,1m41x90,2.5,12.5,747.0,0.16129032258064516,144.28057510555556,0.7403853156538809,553.067830793449,Community Discussion,high

This move, funded through their at-the-market (ATM) offering (~$3.6M), significantly reduces dilution risk and helps clean up the capital structure.

🔹 Why this matters:
	•	These warrants were issued just a couple months ago (May 2025), so taking them off the table now shows urgency to restore investor confidence.
	•	This follows their planned 1-for-200 reverse ADS split, part of efforts to maintain Nasdaq compliance and reframe the stock’s optics.
	•	Biotechs often suffer from overhang issues — NCNA is actively working to eliminate those.

📊 Price action:
	•	Stock rallied ~7% intraday, and after-hours showed another ~13% spike.
	•	Could see a technical breakout if volume holds this week.

💡 The setup:
	•	Tiny float, penny-level pricing, short interest rising, and now less dilution risk.

A lot of high short interest stocks are flying these days. Figured it would be helpful to [get a list of most shorted stocks](https://rallies.ai/chat/1f7a2f91-8231-48fa-9cf4-d6354dc93aca). Will see if any of these have any options activity recently and try to build some plays.

I particularly like WIT KHC HPE and VALE. Was also looking at few other stocks and looks like SOFI also has a decently high short interest. I found KSS through this list a couple days ago, and it moved big today.

Canadians increased their net position in US stocks by $14.2 billion in May, more than 4x the volume last year. It was 88% higher than the previous cycle peak in May 2021, and the biggest net increase for the month on record. Only 6 months in the past 37 years of data have seen larger net increases just one prior to 2020, and most within the past two years. 

May net investment in US stocks was typically minimal often negative prior to 2020. Pulling out of volatile American markets and reallocating the capital into Canadian investment properties was nearly a national pastime.

**What did I learn from today:** Some days I should just shut down the computer. It's not worth trading. Today's price action was so slow a lethargic. And all the pops were getting sold into. I really was going to shut down but kept it open for recording sake. Got enticed by confirmations.

**What needs to be improved:** I need to get better at not taking less-than-ideal trades. Those are what hurt me. $30 here $20 there $50 there. They all add up to hundreds of dollars that would be profits actually. 

**Missed Opportunities and Why:** Missed opportunity to just get out and not trade. Stuck around and just started seeing setups that aren't even there. Good thing I downsized and traded with 1 contract.

I journaled every day. I reviewed every single trade, even the ones I didn't take. I spent time each weekend analyzing my performance : what I did right, what I did wrong, and what I needed to adjust. That process alone kept me grounded.

  
Fast forward to this week, all it took was two days of clean price action and I was ready. Because I had been patient. Because I had done the prep. I took just two trades both winners and now I’m in profit for the month.

Consolidated net income of **$28.2 billion.**   
  
**My assumptions**

I tried to estimate Alphabet’s fair value using both a P/E multiple approach and a discounted cash‑flow (DCF) model. 

|Assumption|Low|Mid|High|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Earnings per share (starting point)**|**$5.5**|**$7.4**|**$8.0**|

|**Discount rate**|**14 %**|**12 %**|**10 %**|

My growth assumptions are lower than Alphabet’s recent 14 % revenue growth because I don't think Google can sustain >20 % EPS growth over a decade. I am also very worried about the DOJ forcing  major changes to Google’s search business - and this is beyond the risk that ChatGPT/OpenAI are causing.

📘 The Little Book That Beats the Market – Key Ideas

1. Mr. Market offers prices daily—irrational in the short term, but right in the long run.


2. Stock prices can swing ±50% yearly, while business value changes ~5–10%.


3. Buy great businesses (high ROIC) at cheap prices (high earnings yield).


4. The Magic Formula = Rank by ROIC + Rank by Earnings Yield → Buy top stocks.


5. The formula uses last year’s numbers—good enough on average.


6. Avoid predictions—use real, historical data instead.


7. Avoid micro-caps (< $50M market cap)—too risky and illiquid.


8. The strategy may underperform for 2–3 years—stay patient.


9. Over any 3-year period, the formula has historically beaten the market.


10. Use a margin of safety—buying cheap protects against being wrong.


11. Own at least 20 stocks to reduce volatility.


12. With sector diversification and your own filtering, 8 stocks may be enough.


13. It’s better to own 5–8 stocks you know well than 30 you don’t.

According to experts, this shift is driven by rising institutional interest, clearer rules, and the desire for higher returns. HNIs are allocating 2-5% of their portfolios to digital assets, treating crypto with measured caution to balance risk and reward. Next-generation heirs are also driving the adoption of cryptocurrencies, pushing for digital diversification and embedding it into succession and estate planning. While Bitcoin is not replacing gold, it is becoming a complementary asset class, with experts predicting a significant rise in allocations toward Bitcoin in the next five years.

Infrastructure decay/replacement cycle. The amount of bridges, roads, water systems, and power grids that need massive overhaul in the next decade is staggering, but most infrastructure plays still seem reasonably valued compared to tech darlings.

Nearshoring/friendshoring. Everyone talks about it, but I don't think the market has fully grasped how much manufacturing will actually move closer to end markets over the next 5-10 years. Supply chain resilience is becoming a strategic imperative, not just a cost optimization.

Water scarcity. Climate change gets attention, but water specifically seems underappreciated relative to how acute this problem is becoming globally.

I went to the bank that issued the check, and asked the teller before cashing it whether the person who issued the check will know if I cash it? She seemed like she didn't fully understand my question and just said, ""Oh yeah, sure!""

I ripped the check up and left. But to be honest, she sounded like she was just saying whatever she thought I wanted to hear. So I don't trust what she said.

For those actually trying to learn about stock picking / for those who have and want to share ideas, I wanted to start posting some slightly less regarded content for those interested in trading and investing their personal portfolios on 6-12month+ horizon. So here’s my first contribution:

I got long ASML this past week following earnings. Basic investment thesis:
1. Stock was unfairly dumped because the CEO was honest about the uncertainty of tariffs, in-spite of a killer earnings quarter
2. The risk of tariffs doesn’t materially impact ASML more than many of the other player in the global semiconductor supply chain yet it’s the only one being punished

We currently have a mortgage with about $320k left at 6.5%. We put 10% down when we bought the house for 370k a couple years ago.

When the stock sells off 5% or more after earnings, it portends continued weakness in the stock, as well as the S&P in general.

When Netflix sells off at earnings, the forward returns for 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks has always underperformed the baseline in the past. That is not to say those forward returns are negative. The 2m S&P median is over 1%. It means that it returns lower than any randomly-selected normal mean/median window. 

In terms of actual trades, this is difficult, because volatility is very low. Short volatility not great. The netflix selloffs portend a very high amount of volatility for the stock itself.

Why is this significant?

TSLA has already risen by approximately 12% in July, breaking through the $180-$190 range and approaching the resistance level near $240.

Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) continues to support electric vehicle tax credits and renewable energy subsidies  and the market had already partially factored in the expectation that “if Trump were elected, subsidies might be terminated.”

However, if Trump now states that he is willing to retain these subsidies at least for Musk that would be a clear positive for TSLA bulls.

Looking for Cheap Stocks? Healthcare Shares Haven’t Looked This Good in 30 Years. - Barron’s 

By  Andrew Bar
July 21, 2025

Healthcare stocks now are at their cheapest level relative to the overall market in 30 years following a tough first half for former industry leaders such as UnitedHealth Group, Merck , and Pfizer.

That could offer opportunities, since growth-oriented investors who once gravitated towards healthcare have pivoted to other sectors, notably technology, industrials, and even electric utilities.

The portfolio strategy team at Goldman Sachs ranks the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 index by absolute and relative price/earnings ratios.

Healthcare stocks now trade for 16 times forward earnings, compared to 30 for technology and 22 for the S&P 500 index. Most sectors are cheap versus their 10- and 30-year averages relative to the S&P 500 index, but health",Basics / Getting Started,1m62awy,1.0,5.0,339.0,0.65,87.34696399444444,0.8336239799558784,316.49852920504276,Analysis & Education,medium
